00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.400
hello everyone and welcome to the latest
episode of the padreon my name is james

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.000
i'm nick and the silence has been filled
silence has lifted and i'm back home

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.280
nick is back from a month in ontario
and

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.400
already being put to work doing a
podcast

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.480
um we have a new podcast set up and i
think this will be the first episode to

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.680
go
on to normal podcast services because

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.679
i've had a couple of you request that
they not just be youtube videos

8
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.520
and so i think i figured out a way to do
it um

9
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.079
and so yeah this one should be available
on like itunes and spotify and all that

10
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.840
stuff so hopefully it will be and if it
is there'll be links in the description

11
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.239
and if it's not i'm sorry i'll try again
next week

12
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.840
so nick how was your time off um
actually it was really nice i know we

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.840
have like an actual topic but yeah yeah
we'll just go with it i i think i had a

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.320
good time you you think um i think i did
some good things some bad things

15
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.479
um
such as life touch is life uh family

16
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.439
that's the thing about vacationing with
family is that you're gonna kind of get

17
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.400
wrapped into that family drama i would
have just like to have like a while i

18
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.960
don't do it
a week in like a trailer on a lake

19
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.119
you know yeah i've been looking at
like airbnbs

20
00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.200
around here and some of them are really
nice and they're not expensive and i'm

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.439
like because i would just love to get
even like three or four days

22
00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.920
away where there's no internet
just completely disconnect

23
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.439
like go to bed when it's it gets dark
out like that kind of reset your

24
00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.320
circadian rhythm yeah but none of them
have air conditioning

25
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.680
um like i'm not gonna have to bring an
air conditioner with me i mean that's an

26
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.600
idea
i mean yeah but it's a [ __ ]

27
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.280
um i did put the old one in the storage
unit now i know that but i just mean you

28
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.159
know if i'm paying you
1500 pounds

29
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.759
i i think i'm entering a period of my
life where i just kind of want to

30
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.880
abandon
apartments and live in a trailer on a

31
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.920
lake
for a little bit

32
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.720
you know i was actually watching a uh a
documentary on youtube

33
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.680
literally last night of people who uh in
the united states who buy trailers

34
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.959
because you know they're obviously a
whole lot less expensive than houses

35
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.480
yeah um
but then they get evicted from the

36
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.599
trailer they own
because they don't own the land it's the

37
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.160
land it's on and because the trailer has
been you know kind of set up they've got

38
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.000
decks and stuff they can't just pick it
up and wheel it away and so they're

39
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.040
homeless even though they bought their
home and they owned their home well i

40
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.080
wouldn't build a deck america i'd keep
it attached to i don't know some pickup

41
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.599
truck thing i guess something with
wheels yeah something with wheels so

42
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.280
that way i can get up and go if i need
to i'm feeling very mobile

43
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.440
i'm feeling very
i want more connection to nature

44
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.040
um
i just want to get out and do stuff you

45
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.400
know
sure yeah nature

46
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.920
nature i kind of feel that i've been
kind of not go live off the grid

47
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.159
unibomber style like you're talking
about but yeah okay but uh there's

48
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.280
there's more nuance to that like my
grandparents lived in trailers for a lot

49
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.800
of my life
um so i lived in trailers when i went to

50
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.120
visit them they owned a trailer that was
on a lake that kind of used as a cottage

51
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.239
that wasn't that far out of the town
that they were that they're living in

52
00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.879
but so like that's kind of what i'm
envisioning i'm not envisioning like

53
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.599
going to live out in the boonies like
you know like there are plenty of like

54
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.959
camping sites and like trailer trailer
parks and stuff not trailer parks but

55
00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.239
like parks that accommodate trailer
parking

56
00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.599
uh camp campsites

57
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.799
because uh trailer parks is where you do
get into those like you know permanent

58
00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.040
mobile homes like there's a decks and
what i'm envisioning is much more closer

59
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.280
to a campsite that you can drive a
trailer up to

60
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.879
uh it wouldn't be for me um no no
trailers are

61
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.200
too
confined for me very cozy

62
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.760
too confined
uh i find our apartment too small yeah

63
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.400
sometimes so
even when you were gone i was like

64
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.680
how did you enjoy your time when i
wasn't here

65
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.560
it was very nice kind of just being able
to do whatever the hell i wanted at any

66
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.199
time do i restrict you that much
well i just mean like where i'd be like

67
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.360
i'm going to stream tonight and just
like stream and not kind of ask you do

68
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.800
you want to be a part of it or anything
like that yeah i would just do it yeah

69
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.479
where i would just be like oh there's
this thing on netflix and then just sit

70
00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.639
down and watch you know all of it i came
to a very sad realization something i'm

71
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.800
a little bit envious of you of is i have
not

72
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.680
slept
by myself as in like in an apartment in

73
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.280
a house by myself
since roughly the same time we met

74
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.000
yeah i haven't had my own isolated
sleeping space from anyone and i have

75
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.880
given you that from time to time when i
go to visit home well yeah and like the

76
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.520
thing is because
the times that i i rare very rarely

77
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.680
visit home um and so the times that i do
visit home

78
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.800
they tended to be dramatic moments yeah
that i went with you to go do yeah kind

79
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.639
of give you like a bit of a shoulder
yeah um and so yeah that's kind of

80
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.720
something i was thinking of was like
i was like you had mentioned to me that

81
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.080
you were uh trying to get a trailer
while you were there

82
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.600
and i was like oh that'd be good because
then nick could have like actual alone

83
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.759
time because your vacation was going to
live with other people for a little

84
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.360
while other people who seem to just
attract drama into their lives

85
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.039
um and we won't name names whereas i'm
just so easygoing and there's no drama

86
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.160
ever with i mean there's
i mean

87
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.880
you're giving me a look
there's no like drama no there's no

88
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.280
drama but like i mean unless youtube
does something douchey

89
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.400
i hope you don't take it the wrong way
when i say like i

90
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.160
am ready to live alone
no i am absolutely ready get out to live

91
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.520
alone and just kind of
control my own space

92
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.039
well yeah i mean i'm i
am completely in agreement there like

93
00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.060
even like the places that i've been
looking at um

94
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.560
[Music]
like say moving to vancouver like the

95
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.440
idea is to get there and then you find
your own place yeah but i'm still

96
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.280
looking for two bedrooms not so that you
necessarily you could be comfortable

97
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.800
while you're there which you know that
you you want a den i want a place where

98
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.840
i can set up a shooting area yeah um
and so it's like

99
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.919
i completely get the urge
to live alone

100
00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.960
because i have lived alone before when i
was in business school and stuff like

101
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.520
that and at times it can get very lonely
and here's the thing like i have never

102
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.000
like even before we moved in together
when i was living alone i was renting a

103
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.880
room in a winter house yeah i have never
ever ever had my own living space

104
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.400
although i can say
during the pandemic had i been living

105
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.560
alone i would have gone crazy
i think i did go crazy slash m going

106
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.160
crazy i'm trying to fix things uh but
yeah like i do kind of approach because

107
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.360
we've lived together together for so
long i do approach

108
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.759
a lot of the idea of sort of saying like
i need to sort of not break ties with

109
00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.840
james but i need to sort of you know
create some some physical distance

110
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.080
um i i feel really guilty when i do
about that because i'm like oh my god

111
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.240
like james is this little dog that if i
leave him alone he's gonna like [ __ ] all

112
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.199
over the all of the furniture like
because he's just so anxious and

113
00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:41.520
neurotic and he he will be so lonely and
lost without me so like

114
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.280
yes i do approach that with a bit of
guilt when talking about that um i'm the

115
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.240
anxious and neurotic one i mean you have
your moments i do but when i'm when i'm

116
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.599
like well while you were gone there
would be instances where i'd be like i'm

117
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.720
kind of lonely i have nothing to do i
have no one to talk to and i just do a

118
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.840
stream and there i have a couple hundred
people to talk to

119
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.479
um
but yeah i totally get

120
00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:06.479
what you're talking about and that's why
you know in the hopefully near future as

121
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:11.120
in like
within a year hopefully

122
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.680
we will have relocated somewhere
that

123
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.680
that can happen yeah we can accommodate
that yeah

124
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.919
uh so what are we actually supposed to
do you actually missed my queue um i

125
00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:27.360
made a segue to talk about the subject
today is we're going to be talking about

126
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.880
guilt and shame and i literally said
oh right

127
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.039
pick up on it i forgot what we were
talking about so yes um we are talking

128
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.919
today about guilt and shame which is
something we both feel because we missed

129
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.320
a week of the patreon
i especially because i was very like you

130
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.560
were on vacation so that's like another
it wasn't supposed to be a month long

131
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.760
yeah yeah but like i was not on vacation
and so i did a week where i was like

132
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.519
okay i'll read some chapters of my book
and then i didn't have enough chapters

133
00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:05.120
of my book to do a second episode of and
so i was trying to think of one and then

134
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.399
i
decided to do one that was just kind of

135
00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:12.080
a rant
and it was a

136
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.560
rant about disney's complete destruction
of uh inner in intellectual property

137
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.000
rights
and that's a video went on for a bit

138
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.080
that's a video 40 minutes just me like
kind of spewing my knowledge from film

139
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.600
school and business school and
everything

140
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.959
and it wasn't recording oh
and so that's why there wasn't an

141
00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:39.839
episode is this one recording i've got i
hope so is it is it recording

142
00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:43.279
i can't see the screen
the screen's too far away it seems like

143
00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:46.560
it's recording yes it's recording
numbers are moving

144
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.360
numbers go up stonks

145
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:55.040
but yeah i felt very guilty about that i
feel guilty that there's not a video out

146
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.320
this week i feel guilty there's not
gonna be this week

147
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.959
i did this is just my
like i know you take it like not you

148
00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:07.040
don't take this nearly not i don't want
to say nearly as seriously but like to

149
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.440
heart as i do i i think you're wrong
about that i think that i do it's just

150
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.720
that i am kind of on a once a month um
keel and i think we need to relax from

151
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.240
whereas i'm like yeah let's put out a
half hour every week

152
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.040
um
like i i'm like yeah we should be a

153
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.920
network show like we should just be
pounding these out and yeah you know the

154
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.040
two of us instead of having a crew yeah
yeah and

155
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.959
i i i keep trying to kind of reel you
back from that kind of expectation

156
00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:36.720
because it isn't
it might be feasible but it's not

157
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.279
realistic that's not sustainable because
we were living on that kind of keel

158
00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.240
coming into this in terms of not not in
terms of what we're producing but in

159
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.279
terms of just word count and that's
exhausting

160
00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:51.519
without excuse me um
especially because we're both trying to

161
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:55.839
get other stuff going on the go so we
need more time to kind of to ourselves

162
00:10:55.839 --> 00:11:00.000
so that we can have time needed for
you know working on other projects and

163
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.959
self-care i mean i again i and i say
this because

164
00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:09.200
this is my job
so everything else is secondary to this

165
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.800
like secondary projects like telos is
very important but right now telos is

166
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.920
being held up by the lack of actors in
the area

167
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.880
um
and other than that all my other side

168
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.720
projects they are side projects they're
not important

169
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.519
to this
and

170
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:31.680
that's why i feel so much guilt when i'm
not constantly putting out stuff

171
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.959
for not just the youtube channel but for
patrons

172
00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:39.680
because
i it's kind of like

173
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.399
i have a job that i like and if i'm not
working at it one thousand percent of

174
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:47.920
the time
what if it's not there anymore okay well

175
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.079
that working at one thousand percent is
first of all what fast food employers

176
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:55.920
expect of their employees so we're not
going to work on that business model and

177
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.360
it also leads to an incredible amount of
burnout very easily

178
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.639
and when you're burnt out you cannot
make optimal content optimal content

179
00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:08.480
um
you know once again like it is okay to

180
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.279
kind of you know not necessarily do
nothing but make a more regular kind of

181
00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.920
keel of videos because remember there
was a time when you were starting out

182
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.839
when it was kind of like oh if we don't
get out and get one out this month we'll

183
00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.600
do we'll do in another two weeks and we
kind of had this six week sort of

184
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.560
uh rollover that we was also working
full-time yeah that's true at the time

185
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.399
and the government was giving out free
money at the time but so like well you

186
00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:36.839
feel and that component of guilty thing
about not working hard enough

187
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:41.760
um like we're already doing a lot
comparative to some other

188
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.079
video essayists but next to nothing
compared to other ones

189
00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:50.399
like if you if if we were to just like
sit down and go like okay let's look at

190
00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:53.760
other
other people who do video essays and

191
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.880
let's
compare our

192
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.040
um output
then you've got some video essayists who

193
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.760
like contra points do like a video a
year

194
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.040
and then you've got other ones who do
like two or three videos a week yeah and

195
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:14.000
they're like an hour long right
um but we also do go for a ramped up

196
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.480
production quality um in terms of like
kind of making these mini documentaries

197
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.480
oh yeah like that's one of the things is
like i it's you know they're they're

198
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.000
scripted but it's very much kind of
talking to the camera there might be

199
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.120
some cutaways you know
um

200
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.200
not likely
going ahead and or it's

201
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.560
you know voice over with
um

202
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.839
b-roll which is actually harder to do
than filming

203
00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:43.600
uh it's it's harder to do because
there's nothing to cut away to when

204
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.560
you're like i don't know what to put
over this shot yeah yeah it's uh

205
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.440
it's it's crazy how some of like our
contemporaries

206
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.399
just churn stuff out and like on their
own like they're like a one-person gay

207
00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.800
yeah
and

208
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.760
like i am amazed at these people
and a part of my brain is like we should

209
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.880
be doing that and then a part of my
brain is like

210
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.279
well no because then we can't do a video
like the hannibal video no no no um and

211
00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:17.440
that's also just not the way that i'm
capable of writing like me personally as

212
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.480
like someone who contributes to a lot of
these things so if you want to do that

213
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.040
much you'd be kind of out on your own
for that

214
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.320
um
so i just want to say like you know like

215
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.560
it's not that
i'm not saying that it's feasible i'm

216
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.480
saying that i feel guilty that i don't
do it um you want to talk about guilt

217
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.920
and shame that's where my guilt and
shame are

218
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.800
because i feel like i'm not earning
the it just scares me a little bit when

219
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.680
you talk about that because i'm like i
can't do that anymore because that was

220
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.440
like the first half of the year and like
i i got into a really bad place about

221
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.360
that so i don't really feel a whole lot
of guilt and shame about not producing

222
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.839
that much content because like
for me doing that much content leads to

223
00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:01.120
like not nice places
yeah

224
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.519
um whereas for me i just have this
constant anxiety of if i'm not churning

225
00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:09.040
out things will you know the patron
numbers drop

226
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.760
will
you know they've only really dropped

227
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.160
when they don't when we don't produce
videos about anime

228
00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:20.800
i mean no no didn't a few people leave
patreon and they said like you're not

229
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.560
making enough animals a couple did yes a
couple of patrons did i'm making that as

230
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.680
a joke um and said specifically this is
legit some left and messaged me on

231
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.240
patreon saying i was expecting more
anime content

232
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.340
and i'm like
there's some coming

233
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.560
[Laughter]
uh

234
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.079
like given that it's been like a year
since we no two years since yuri on ice

235
00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:53.040
um i think so it hasn't been two years
yuri on ice was last

236
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.360
uh one question were we living here yes
last year

237
00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.040
yes okay so that was we did not do yuri
on ice in this

238
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.480
yeah we did we did yuri on ice here oh
my god we did we did everything after

239
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.600
i did i only did three videos in the
other part right right right because the

240
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.160
um power couples video we shot in my
room

241
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.600
for part of it part of it yeah yeah
um

242
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.040
it still boggles my mind that power
couples and killing stocking are the

243
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.639
most viewed videos on the channel and
they came out one after the other and

244
00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:25.519
i'm like what happened during that
period of time

245
00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:30.959
that just like shoved everyone to our
channel and where did they go

246
00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:34.000
i mean you have been getting like a
steady increase of like subscribers and

247
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.639
like we do have the patreon so like oh
yeah like the the patreon has really

248
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:42.880
like you guys have
taken a load off of my shoulders like

249
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.680
not having to deal with youtube's
maniacal yeah insanity um

250
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.880
which is wonderful
but um

251
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.759
we are going to put out some videos that
are more

252
00:16:55.759 --> 00:17:00.079
youtube friendly the camp videos were
not youtube friendly they were that we

253
00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:04.400
we we're looking at that as our gift to
pride yeah that was our pride month

254
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.600
video gift yeah and then my queer's folk
video was guilt and gays and for not

255
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.400
watching it
um

256
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.439
and
some of the reactions to that are

257
00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:19.280
hilarious they are like so you get some
hilarious reaction reactions to all of

258
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.319
all of your videos like there's so many
people who are like oh my god i was

259
00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.160
watching this at 12 at like at midnight
too and then there's other people who

260
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.160
are just like this is the worst thing
that was ever created we should never

261
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.000
admit that feminine gays exist and also
we should never admit that masculine

262
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.640
gays exist we should never admit that
gays like to have sex we should never

263
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.320
admit that gays don't like to have sex
we should like yeah like just all of it

264
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.200
it's hilarious how many queer people do
not want queer people to exist yeah

265
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.280
it's depressing like we're
we're touted as a community that sort of

266
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.280
appreciates diversity and yet we want
diversity in a very specific way

267
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.360
i'm annoyed by that
yeah i think um most of us don't even

268
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.520
want diversity
well that's what i mean like they don't

269
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.320
give us like pride season it's like you
get the little white twinks they're like

270
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.919
yeah diversity but i don't take black
guys like

271
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.160
you know
um

272
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.679
so when it comes to me and guilt and
shame i feel a lot more guilt and shame

273
00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:17.919
over the fact that i have barely written
any fiction since i published my last

274
00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:21.919
since i published the novel
um like i put that out and i kind of

275
00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:26.000
held it to myself like okay by the
beginning of 2023 i'm gonna have a

276
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.440
sequel out that's not gonna happen and i
feel really bad about that

277
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.480
um
like there's a sense that like by kind

278
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.720
of leaving it i feel like i've abandoned
it like it's my baby and i've abandoned

279
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.880
it and like
i'm constantly like going like

280
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.919
uh the first half of this year was
swathed and book awards that were coming

281
00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:47.600
out and i had no idea that was going on
because i was trying to keep my head up

282
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.919
my head screwed on straight to kind of
keep like working so i feel like i

283
00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:54.400
missed a whole bunch i feel like i
basically just abandoned it and that i

284
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.520
gave up so that's that's how i feel
about that

285
00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.200
um
i'm afraid this podcast is going to turn

286
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.160
into a therapy session i mean
have you been on the discords

287
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.760
no
no i go on the patreon discord uh the

288
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.400
discord is um a lot of trauma dumping
that it's apparently just especially in

289
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.039
like the um the nsfw section like it's a
lot of just people being really really

290
00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:23.200
sad
just where they go to talk about it i'm

291
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.280
sad enough watching gay shows like this
didn't happen to me

292
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.600
uh yeah that's a problem um so like i
i do really want to get reinvested in my

293
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.160
fiction uh a sequel to avalon night
isn't going to happen next i'm working

294
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.600
on the thing that is probably going to
get out there somewhere or like i'm

295
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.280
going to maybe try and ship it out to
agents if i can

296
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.039
um
so like when it comes to me and guilt

297
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:52.400
it's not about like i need to deliver
for the people consuming this it's more

298
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.480
about like i need to
keep at this for my sake like you know

299
00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.640
like i feel like by abandoning it i've
lost steam and then i'll never be able

300
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.080
to get back into it and that this baby
that i created is just going to

301
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.760
basically die on the vine um
so it's more of an intrinsic uh sense of

302
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.200
guilt and shame that i feel rather than
some something that's directed to a

303
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.520
group of people yeah
um

304
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.880
i'm also feeling guilt and shame about
my mom um

305
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.960
going back was difficult for that reason
um just kind of feeling like i'm not

306
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.919
being there when mom is kind of going
through

307
00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:36.880
she she's in rough shape um
because it has been two and a half years

308
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.200
since i've been home
yes pandemics do that i know but it's a

309
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.039
long that is not your fault i know it's
not my fault but still like i i just um

310
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.880
it doesn't help that even now they
apparently the province just has given

311
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.960
up on masks entirely yeah nobody wears
masks in ontario literally well okay

312
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.000
like two or three people in a crowd of a
hundred but

313
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.240
like
the airport is

314
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.120
here is
technically you're supposed to wear your

315
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.280
mask but there were people like arriving
and taking their masks off and i wanted

316
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.919
to like leap over gates and like
cover their mouths and be like

317
00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:17.440
keep your germs away from us
i mean like

318
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.760
from what i've heard like i you know was
tangentially attached to a few people

319
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.440
who were like around my mom's orbit and
they were getting covered sometimes and

320
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.320
like apparently it's just like a few day
cold these days if you're triple waxed

321
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.280
um
it can be it can get rough but like it's

322
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.240
asthmatic yeah yeah like that's the
whole thing like so many people kind of

323
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.159
take it very lightly that they're like
oh it was like a cold and maybe you know

324
00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:46.799
a light flu and that sucked for a couple
of days but uh but then there are people

325
00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:50.159
who
have compromised immune systems and who

326
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:53.919
have breathing problems and for them
it's not a two-day cold it's a hospital

327
00:21:53.919 --> 00:21:57.679
right uh it's it's going to the er it's
being admitted it's being it's being put

328
00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:01.919
on
oxygen even like i l i personally know

329
00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:08.480
someone who um went to vegas
just recently um

330
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.200
and they're triple vaxxed and they got
covered in vegas

331
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.200
and
they are currently in the hospital

332
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.960
and they are currently on oxygen yeah i
haven't checked the state of covent in a

333
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.880
very long time like what kind of what
it's like with hospitals or like

334
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.720
the hospitals aren't like overflowing
here or anything like that but what i'm

335
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.880
saying is that like
i wish people wouldn't be so nonchalant

336
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.840
about it because there are people who
you know they have even when they can

337
00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.000
get all the vaccinations there are
complications what i don't understand is

338
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.400
like
how is covered going to just kind of go

339
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.400
away like is it like

340
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.679
because like well that's the thing this
is the thing that no one is that no one

341
00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:54.720
is
thinking about and i apologize to

342
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.760
everyone listening to this that this
isn't more upbeat i wanted this to be an

343
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.640
upbeat podcast um
but

344
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.600
we as a society
for so long have just said oh you have

345
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.320
medical problems
[ __ ] off

346
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.799
i want to live my life
i don't care if you have a compromised

347
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:20.880
immune system or breathing problems or
accessibility issues i don't care

348
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.000
not on my plate
and

349
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.840
for a while during covid we were
thinking about those people

350
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.919
and now that you know able-bodied people
have decided that covet is over we have

351
00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:40.159
once again forgotten about them and
i think that is horribly cruel

352
00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:44.159
and so everyone walking around without
masks and stuff and being like i've

353
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:48.960
earned this it's like
there are so many people

354
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.000
not just in your life but around you
who

355
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.840
are immunocompromised
who they

356
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.720
right
by you saying i've earned this i get to

357
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.080
go have fun again we
there they can't leave their house but

358
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.600
i'm just i'm not i'm not certainly it's
i'm not i'm not attacking that or kind

359
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.120
of advocating for that attitude i'm sort
of

360
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.840
like in a po in sort of like um
what i'm saying is we need to

361
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.200
acknowledge that these people exist and
we need to

362
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.400
we need to
um

363
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.320
better
make society work for them better yeah

364
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.720
yeah um the ableism argument
um i'm just kind of in a catastrophizing

365
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.000
about like how is coped going to end
like because it doesn't seem like

366
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.320
there's going to be any more shutdowns
it doesn't seem like there's going to be

367
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.520
more regulations against it
so i i'm kind of questioning like what's

368
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.320
what's the next sort of step for covet
well i'm not a doctor or an immunologist

369
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.880
so i can't really tell you that
my thought process in it is wear masks

370
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.440
in public
oh but masks are so inconvenient yeah

371
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.520
well none of us have gotten the flu in
the last two years so

372
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.360
i need to buy new maps put your masks on
i forgot one in ontario and i don't like

373
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.279
the other one that i have
everyone always compliments you because

374
00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:13.520
you have the majora's mask mask and like
you haven't even played the game from

375
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.520
like i've tried playing tried playing
the game but it's like my favorite game

376
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.559
and there's one of my favorite games i
can get to the swamp and i'm just like

377
00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:24.159
and people are like oh my god i love
that game and i'm there i'm beside you

378
00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:28.720
like it's my favorite game
he hasn't even played it i couldn't get

379
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.640
like a hyrule crest
mask or anything majora's mask was the

380
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.919
only mask i could get
it's madora's mask mask um majora's mask

381
00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:42.640
mask mask for mask
mask on mask

382
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.799
yeah see now we're making the podcast
horny like

383
00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:50.320
i i thought we were just making it dumb

384
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.880
no mask on mask like
it's like oh yeah like a mask

385
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.279
yeah yeah um
but yeah back to

386
00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:05.039
guilt and shame guilt and shame i also
like feel an immense amount of

387
00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:08.480
shame
around tello stuff

388
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.760
because
they

389
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.840
kind of
i expected there to be much more

390
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.559
interest from actors
in the area um

391
00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:25.600
and at least by posting on job sites
there has not been i'm going to go

392
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.039
basically go out and
create flyers and put them on every

393
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:32.640
telephone pole in the city i should just
i should design some tomorrow and like

394
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.120
put them in bus stops and everywhere and
to get people to you know go to the

395
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.960
website and you know
send in their application and stuff like

396
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.640
that
um because i'm like well you know there

397
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.080
might be a lot of people who aren't
currently looking for work

398
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.760
and so they're not seeing the yeah yeah
that we're looking for who do have

399
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.240
acting experience but they're not
looking for work so they wouldn't know

400
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.880
where to where to find exactly uh so
that's the next step because the script

401
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.159
is done
and so well it's not done the first

402
00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:06.480
draft is done oh it's done done yeah
okay um do you want to send it to me so

403
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.440
i can give it a read no i need to
um give it a read myself that's fair

404
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.880
um
but uh

405
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.600
like my my
i was

406
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.520
so married to this is going to come out
in october it's going to be a horror

407
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.120
thing a halloween thing
and then it became a feature film

408
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.240
accidentally it went from a half hour to
120 page script

409
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.399
um
which is supposed to roughly tr nick

410
00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:37.760
keeps dropping things on the floor i
don't have a fidget toy

411
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.919
um
but uh

412
00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:46.320
i forget what i was saying i went from a
to 100 page script

413
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.159
from
30 30 minute short film to 120 page

414
00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:54.559
script which roughly translates to about
an hour and 20 minutes which is

415
00:27:54.559 --> 00:28:00.240
which is um it roughly translates to 120
minutes which is two hours

416
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.080
um
so we'll see what happens there uh

417
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.960
probably not coming out in october now
but it's gonna be an actual like

418
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.640
feature-length movie and so i've been
trying to figure out oh god how do i

419
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.320
make this and so uh instead of just
putting it on my youtube channel we're

420
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.799
going to have a special premiere for
obviously everyone who supported it on

421
00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:24.559
uh indiegogo as well as all of you guys
on patreon um you'll be invited to the

422
00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:30.080
special premiere of it and then it will
be put on youtube for 1.99

423
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.080
um
so two dollars for a movie yeah and

424
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.520
that's that's to purchase it that's not
to rent it so for two bucks you get the

425
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.760
movie and
hopefully that way there's a possibility

426
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.679
of making back some of the budget that
can then go into making more movies more

427
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:48.880
movies instead of just kind of relying
on

428
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.480
well let's hope somebody at a film
festival sees it and likes it yeah um

429
00:28:54.559 --> 00:29:00.080
but i do feel a lot of guilt about
basically not having

430
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.440
like schedules done and not having like
shooting schedules ready and and and we

431
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.840
were kind of afraid that actors would be
a hard thing to find where we are but we

432
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.480
weren't expecting it to be like this
destitute yeah because like there's

433
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.440
there's a lot of actors where we are
which is why i'm like are they not

434
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.600
getting the memo like are they not
seeing this on the job boards and that's

435
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.279
why i want to put it out on like every
yeah um

436
00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:32.159
ever go to the um some of the local
theaters here and kind of um

437
00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:36.080
i would have to i don't know any local
theaters

438
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.080
here
the neptune

439
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.360
yeah but they're
that's you sign like

440
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.720
um
not confidentiality act exclusivity

441
00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.039
agreements
yeah non-competition yeah i don't it

442
00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:52.000
wouldn't really become but competing but
sure that's fine

443
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.120
yeah so it's all
it's all a nightmare which is one of the

444
00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.080
reasons i'm looking into moving to a
bigger city where people actually want

445
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.840
to do fun things like make movies yeah
and pretend to be murdered yeah

446
00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.480
a lot of people who need to pretend to
be murdered in this movie

447
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.720
um

448
00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:16.080
but is anyone beheaded
uh no almost so

449
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.640
we are behind multiverse of madness then

450
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.799
well that didn't make it into the movie
that was cut i thought that there were

451
00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:28.320
like ten beheadings that didn't make it
into the movie well no there's one just

452
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.000
went around like slash there was the
beheading of mordo and then delivering

453
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.279
the
head oh my god but that got cut from the

454
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:40.000
movie i can't believe but anyway um
shame and guilt

455
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
uh that movie should inspire a lot of
shame and guilt but sam remy's you know

456
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.320
writing on cloud nine so whatever yeah
cause it made a lot of money

457
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.320
um

458
00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:55.840
that scene had good writing mr raymie
you're known for spider-man and evil

459
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.240
dead
peak writing

460
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.200
peak and that's not saying the
spider-man movies in the evil dead

461
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.039
movies aren't fun it's just no they're
you don't go to those movies for the

462
00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:09.840
writing yeah they're not who's afraid of
virginia woolf no

463
00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:14.799
um
what other guilt and shame

464
00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:20.159
do you have um i generally feel a
perpetual sense of guilt and shame so i

465
00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:24.080
am
you know sometimes i'm over it sometimes

466
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:30.240
i'm not so like that's why i'm like
neurotically obsessed with being meek

467
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.880
some of the time because i feel like
i've done something horribly

468
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.360
unforgivably wrong
and

469
00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:41.919
you know
that's just who i am

470
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.399
how about you
well most of my guilt and shame is

471
00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:50.960
surrounded by
well like guilt is all surrounded by

472
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:58.559
video stuff youtube stuff um
i feel ashamed when videos don't do well

473
00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:02.960
uh like when the camp video just didn't
take off the way i had hoped see like

474
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.640
when it comes to stuff like that i'm
usually able to rationalize for reasons

475
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.720
why after like because we had a bit of a
hiccup with yuri on ice

476
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.760
and that's kind of where i began to
readjust my thinking in terms of like

477
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.440
you know like it there are forces
outside of our control

478
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.559
for why
these things might not do well if

479
00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:23.519
there's a pattern of them doing well oh
absolutely there's

480
00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:27.440
yeah it's like you know the camp video
didn't do well

481
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.880
because
you know that's not exactly a hot search

482
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.120
topic yeah and like we are still
learning how to sort of like um control

483
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.000
what um venues we can
to make sure these videos do well enough

484
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.360
to sort of like because
yeah like i have a patron who works for

485
00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.640
youtube and they have given me some
hints i'm not gonna say any names or

486
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.080
anything but they've given me some hints
of how to

487
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.880
work with the algorithm
and uh our next video is hopefully going

488
00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.000
to do that
hopefully but also realizing that you

489
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.840
know videos just generally don't do well
in the summer so

490
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.320
no
no i thought that was the thing last

491
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.279
year that we learned because that video
is just our videos didn't do well in the

492
00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:11.279
summer but other people's did perfectly
fine some other people's videos did

493
00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:14.399
better than ever in the summer
okay

494
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:17.440
um
it's it

495
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.720
really just seems like what kind of what
are you putting out there

496
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.080
and what i've basically been told by the
youtube

497
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.399
employee
is

498
00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:33.279
niche super niche content
will get super niche views

499
00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:36.720
and since most of the stuff we do is
very niche

500
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.000
the views have not been there whereas
when we do stuff about disney or video

501
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.320
games
does great when we do stuff about

502
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.120
certain anime
banana fish

503
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.760
does great
when we do stuff about manwa with

504
00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.600
killing stalking and uh painter of the
night does great

505
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.399
um
but when we talk about specifically

506
00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:07.600
queer topics like with camp
or um

507
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.760
even heart stopper
um doesn't do so great

508
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.200
because the audience
is

509
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.760
kind of in a bubble
and they're being fed all of this all of

510
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.040
the time
and so one more video is just one more

511
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.399
video to the watch later list right
whereas

512
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:31.760
when there is a
thirsty audience for something

513
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.960
they will watch every video they will
listen to every podcast they want all

514
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.560
the opinions of
from everyone about this thing that they

515
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.839
love or hate
um well that's kind of what we ran into

516
00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:47.919
with the power couples video
like it was kind of just hitting at the

517
00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:51.200
right time to kind of fuel a couple well
yeah because that came out right as one

518
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.639
division did and then killing stocking
which i thought wasn't going to get any

519
00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:58.640
views
it's the most few it's like 1.7 million

520
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.240
views now yeah like that was
just you made that video on a whim

521
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.599
because you're like i read this thing i
need to talk about it yeah like i had

522
00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:08.880
read it like a month earlier
and i was like

523
00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.119
i just i need to make a video about this
because yeah it's a thing

524
00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:17.280
and yeah it's a thing it's a thing it's
still a thing and it's continuing to be

525
00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.760
a thing and the thing will be re-shared
when when the tv show comes out

526
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.000
i might make a new video when the tv
show comes out um

527
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.920
but that's one thing one thing i would
like to ask of you guys because i'm not

528
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:38.000
knowledgeable enough about media spaces
what is really big out there

529
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.720
like what is extremely popular
in

530
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.760
kind of circles that have a queer bent
to it

531
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.920
because
like the next two videos i have planned

532
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.320
um

533
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.720
i think might play the algorithm
properly

534
00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.119
um we shall see
but i would like to know you know what

535
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:09.280
else is out there um
because i want to make more stuff

536
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.520
that people want to see
because by us making more stuff that

537
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.480
people want to see that gives us the
leeway to do you know a two-hour video

538
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.720
about camp yeah or you know fun stuff
every now and then a documentary about

539
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.640
john waters or something like
yeah that was planned for a little bit

540
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.839
and it's like he might be a little bit
like

541
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:34.640
you know very specific audiences yeah
it's very very specific look i want to

542
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.839
make a video about rocky horror and
shock treatment for halloween

543
00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:42.079
um and
you know that's a very niche audience

544
00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:45.280
but i think halloween is kind of the
perfect time of year to release that

545
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.040
kind of video yeah um

546
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.200
but like oh my god that video could be
about censorship

547
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.560
because disney owns rocky horror now
they haven't censored it though they

548
00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.880
haven't done anything with it though
it's just no it's in the pride section

549
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.760
is it on disney plus yeah no way i mean
in canada it's not on disney plus in the

550
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.920
u.s yeah it's on i think it's on hulu in
the u.s i think so it's probably on

551
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.400
hulu's pride section
um

552
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.520
i'm glad they're not just sw sweeping it
under the rug because that thing is a

553
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.599
relic
uh shock treatment though doesn't exist

554
00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:23.599
anywhere yeah nobody is i was i'm the
only person in the world who was who saw

555
00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:26.720
shock treatment before rocky horror
picture so and my queer

556
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.920
my queer sort of
uh guide mentor in high school made

557
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.480
crafted that very deliberately we were
sitting down and she was like you know

558
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.960
what you're going to be the only person
in the world that sees shock treatment

559
00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.160
before rocky horror and
you can kind of work with that in the

560
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.000
video kind of you know expose the
children to shock treatment because

561
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.520
guaranteed none of them have heard of it

562
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.800
no

563
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.400
popular opinion the music and drug
treatment was better than rocky horror

564
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.720
that's very unpopular like rocky horror
had a few like really solid bangers but

565
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.200
every
every song in shock room

566
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.960
it's just a smash like it's it's so good
but anyway um

567
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:15.200
you had magenta and riff raff officially
confirming that they do sleep together

568
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.160
in shock treatment
i mean that was basically confirmed in

569
00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:24.079
rocky horror no no no no
you you see it it's it's a thing

570
00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:30.160
but another thing uh that i feel
like not guilt over

571
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.440
um
but shame over

572
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:39.119
is you know like visual appearance
and i've been getting

573
00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:44.480
an inordinate amount of comments on
youtube videos lately regarding that

574
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.480
um

575
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.280
like somebody commented today you don't
need to wear the turtlenecks you have a

576
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.640
big neck uh you're not fooling anyone
and why why why do you what do you feel

577
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.000
think you're contributing yeah what do
you feel and like you are adding to the

578
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.359
person who said
something like i like your videos but

579
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:09.599
why must we be subjected to your face or
something yeah it's like i'm like

580
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:13.920
oh oh then don't watch them
like i'm like there's lots of people who

581
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.960
just put them on in the background and
don't actually watch them douchebags

582
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.920
yeah like this it's like

583
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.000
and there's been like
the first like

584
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.040
the comments for so long have been like
ah rowling is right blah blah blah i'm

585
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.839
like delete delete delete stuff like
that and only recently have the comments

586
00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:42.800
like started coming for me specifically
and i'm like this is new especially

587
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.920
since my videos are getting less views
than ever

588
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.520
where are you trolls coming from
like

589
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.119
my own
subscribers are not being like told

590
00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:57.680
about my videos
and you're getting them

591
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.599
like what are you doing youtube what is
this um

592
00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:04.800
i don't you know
little secret i don't think youtube

593
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.480
knows how youtube algorithm works don't
either i think that's why they refuse to

594
00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.880
tell anyone how it works because they
don't actually know they have no idea

595
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.839
they put some ones and zeros on a line
and they saw what happened and they're

596
00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:19.839
like this could work yeah they they made
it an algorithm that is reactive to

597
00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:23.280
media trends and pushes things that are
trending in media but like i don't think

598
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.079
the algorithm realizes how to track
popular trends yeah and another comment

599
00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:33.520
that i'm just getting so old
is why aren't you on nebula

600
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.359
and
that is neither guilt nor shame but

601
00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:41.760
frustration well yeah it's because we've
tried it's like i i feel like making a

602
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.800
video
about but even another one that's

603
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.160
getting frustrating
is people saying

604
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.720
i really liked this video
um

605
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.079
i think it basically like i think it
would behoove you

606
00:40:56.079 --> 00:41:02.079
to read slash watch this thing and make
a video about it because it's very

607
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:06.800
important to the community and i'm just
like i did that eight months ago did

608
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.160
that a year ago
oh yeah things that you've already made

609
00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.640
videos yeah i'm like click on my channel
and look at the other things i have to i

610
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.839
have run the gamut girl what was the
thing like last year i think it was

611
00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:20.960
during the summer you got a comment
being like

612
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.800
um
basically saying like if you don't make

613
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.160
a video about given i'm going to stop
watching your videos like i'm going

614
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.200
you're going to lose my support and it's
like

615
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.880
why do you go out of your way to follow
and support someone

616
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:40.000
and then feel implored to dictate what
they do yeah and i do plan on making a

617
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.400
video about giving i think it's gonna i
think it's december i have it scheduled

618
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.319
for
um

619
00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:50.880
because check the schedule so well
because december was going to be the um

620
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.800
gay nintendo queer nintendo video

621
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.680
and june

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:03.280
may i think yeah may may was going to be
given and we flipped them yeah um

623
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.640
so like there is going to be a video
about given and you know dealing with

624
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.119
trauma and all that stuff fun
um

625
00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:13.680
but i'm like

626
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.240
that's why like for everyone every every
time somebody says you need to make a

627
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.040
video about owl house i had an extra
week

628
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:26.160
[Laughter]
crying all right i'll watch it next week

629
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.680
then crying will only make spar crying
will only make bart's mark higher

630
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.520
it's one of my favorite simpsons scenes
like

631
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.560
and like
don't take don't don't get me wrong i

632
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.520
love when you guys like recommend stuff
to me because sometimes it is it becomes

633
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.480
my favorite thing hannibal yuri on ice
banana fish like these things like

634
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.359
became
like hugely

635
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:54.480
like a part of
my life but like there's a like you're

636
00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.560
gonna have to sort of realize that a we
can't really consume all of the media

637
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.400
that gets thrown at us because a lot of
it get a lot a lot gets thrown at you

638
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.960
and b there's no some of it's like 8 000
episodes and like people telling me to

639
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.040
make a video about one piece i'm like
are you gonna pay me for the next year

640
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.599
to sit down and watch it and like be
like there's no guarantee that we're

641
00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:18.319
going to like it
or that we're going to see anything

642
00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:20.240
that's
like like

643
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.280
something like hey i like this thing
it's like that's good i liked it too but

644
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.880
i don't really see a video in it and i
basically have a policy

645
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.040
that for the channel that other than
rolling and disney

646
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.160
i will not make a video about something
that makes me angry

647
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.000
yeah
like

648
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.319
rolling and disney have been
grandfathered in to my i hate you i get

649
00:43:40.319 --> 00:43:44.160
so discouraged about the amount of
people that trump that still stump for

650
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.000
rowling and sort of like basically say
like why have millennials decided they

651
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.839
don't like jk rowling and it's like okay
you're trivializing

652
00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:55.440
and like she trivializes too she says
she she literally says like oh i just

653
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.280
said one thing once and then that was it
and it's like no

654
00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.839
you said that one thing many times
and then gays that bother me

655
00:44:03.839 --> 00:44:07.359
it's the gays that bother me um i got a
message

656
00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:11.040
i would like lined up whatever it is on
tinder

657
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.119
um
with this guy and

658
00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:20.079
like
his profile was all about like

659
00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:25.359
patronus and um
what hogwarts house are you and stuff

660
00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:29.520
like that and like i'm in my brain i'm
like i get it

661
00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.200
because like
you like harry potter

662
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.560
but why is that your personality
no no no

663
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.440
by broadcasting that yeah you're either
saying i agree with her

664
00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:49.040
or i am okay ignoring it yeah and either
way is not okay with me yeah

665
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.760
like
i am slowly but surely replacing all of

666
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.839
my outward-facing harry potter
merchandise with

667
00:44:57.839 --> 00:45:01.680
zelda and attack on titan yep

668
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.200
which some would argue that attack on
titan is more problematic than harry

669
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:11.440
potter i disagree you seem to have
watched a different show yeah

670
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.640
and read a different ma yeah i think
you've watched the show and you haven't

671
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.720
read the manga and you don't know how it
is it's it's the same way that people

672
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.079
watch the boys and somehow think that
homeland is the heroic masculine icon is

673
00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:29.200
like okay yeah or that they like even
then it's like they p they're the joke

674
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.319
that i always go to is like people think
that uh fight club is about promoting

675
00:45:32.319 --> 00:45:37.040
about toxic masculinity it's like no no
like that's not what fight club is it's

676
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.520
not my fault that a bunch of straight
guys the only thing they can take from

677
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.800
it is the only thing you need to talk
the first rule about clyde clubs you'd

678
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.720
not talk about fight club like the point
about fight club is that maybe we should

679
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.280
talk about fight club or else people
might start terrorist organizations yeah

680
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.359
um or like people who watch american
history accident are like yeah this

681
00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:59.359
validates my hatred yeah non-white
people instead of depicting a very

682
00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:04.240
pathetic person who like struggles to
kind of function yeah it's like you're

683
00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.680
watching the wrong movie yeah and and so
like

684
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.960
or you're watching the right movie
you're just reading it all right and

685
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.079
specifically like when it comes to like
the boys and attack on titan i would

686
00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:18.000
like to kind of open a discussion about
um

687
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.040
the condition that media literacy or the
lack of media literacy media literacy

688
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.040
has left art in yeah uh there's no room
for subtlety if you you basically have

689
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.839
to make everything an after school
special where sarah moon says that uh

690
00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:34.480
hey you need to punch fascists um
instead of letting the art speak for

691
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.280
itself we need that after school special
and i'm really troubled by that yeah

692
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.480
and like literally an attack on titan
they do punch the fascists and they're

693
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.200
still like this is fascist they cut the
head off of one of the major fascists

694
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.839
they cut the head off a lot of people
they cut off a lot of heads

695
00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:55.359
but yeah that's basically what the
attack on titan video is going to be is

696
00:46:55.359 --> 00:47:01.280
kind of a dissection of
media literacy and how we seem to have

697
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.640
just given up on it yeah
um and it's coming from both the right

698
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.079
and the left because like at the right
as yeah like oh homelanders of uh

699
00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:10.720
homeland
the right celebrates the thing and says

700
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.640
homelander is a hero and the left
demonizes this and says like its

701
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.680
messaging is too subtle and these
writers now have an icon and it's like

702
00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.119
well yeah it's like
the right says he's a hero and the left

703
00:47:21.119 --> 00:47:26.000
says they say he's a hero so the show
was bad yes yes and like i'm really not

704
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.640
comfortable with that like like
people need to be able to make their own

705
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:34.000
decisions about something
and they need to be able to extrapolate

706
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.040
the messages and cues that an artist is
trying to take away from them i'm just

707
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.280
like you know what my inner grandma is
coming out the producers could never get

708
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.000
made today
honestly though like

709
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.240
honestly though
blazing saddles absolutely not no

710
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.480
blazing titles absolutely not i think
there's more

711
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.720
room for the producers because like they
do specifically in the text of the show

712
00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:02.640
the the play come come out and say like
uh max piastock is a greasy slimy

713
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.680
um
lying cheater and it's like

714
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.559
nathan lane's like yep
that's not inaccurate um i'm a broadway

715
00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:14.240
producer like
um i love that lines it's like you know

716
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:19.359
i was like i was i was a terrible
lying cheating son of a [ __ ]

717
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:24.319
i was a broadway producer thank you for
the condemnation of it but even then is

718
00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:29.599
that too subtle
probably like uh like ah and like with

719
00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:33.599
the people saying that you know victor
from yuri on ice is you know peak

720
00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:38.559
heterosexuality yes like where is media
literacy these days if you can't

721
00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:41.680
see
matching rings and then all of the

722
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.960
little like figure skaters are on the
table basically squealing and saying

723
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.480
we're throwing you a shower yeah like

724
00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.960
and then the straight person say like
i'm also engaged to my wife

725
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.960
yeah it's like
oh my god

726
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.720
like i get that there's censorship but
they are going but because of the

727
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.640
censorship they went harder than they
would have ever had to do otherwise well

728
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.319
yeah like if they could have just shown
the kiss yeah like they wouldn't have

729
00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:15.119
had to go as hard as they did
and because of that it's like the gayest

730
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:20.160
show ever created
it's like queer's focus not as gay as

731
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.800
yuri on ice it's not i'm sorry
it's pretty gay

732
00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.280
like good lord
like given where you actually do have

733
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:36.480
boys kissing not as gay as yuri on ice
like by a country mile

734
00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.240
how's the country about longer than the
city mile

735
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.400
uh because everything is longer in the
country because it's boring it's very

736
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.400
true so i don't go there
i avoid the country at all costs not bad

737
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.760
sometimes
like even the the little like vacation

738
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.040
houses i've been looking at renting
they're like on the water they're not in

739
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.640
the country
well that's why you can't find with air

740
00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.680
conditioning
gotta broaden your search

741
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.800
oh no like some of them say they have
air conditioning but then you see the

742
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.880
pictures and it's like okay it's
probably like a window unit which is

743
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.960
fine but i don't see the window unit in
the in the window so you can always

744
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.280
contact the person selling the plate i
know but that involves talking to people

745
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.720
just send them a message an email yeah i
know but then like what if they email

746
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.240
back and it's like not what i want or
something or they take too long to reply

747
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:28.880
that's fine you can move on jesus oh
it's just so frustrating you give up so

748
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.800
easily people just need to make
everything obvious and just say the

749
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.240
facts
here's the fact sailor moon says this

750
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.800
unit comes with an air conditioner
where is this sailor moon says coming

751
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.240
from i remember that was like the
pinnacle of like after school specials

752
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.720
in like the 90s like you know like
after the episode of sailor moon there

753
00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:52.000
was like the sailor moon says where she
talks about the ethics of the episode i

754
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.760
don't remember that oh my god i never
really watched sailor moon that much as

755
00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.880
a kid i was kind of like ew girls
um

756
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.720
so yeah i don't remember that at all
because it was like you know like this

757
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.400
person did this and we need to remember
to treat this person nicely but this

758
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.359
person did this
that doesn't mean they're a bad person

759
00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:14.160
like i wonder if that was the
americanization of it in the american

760
00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.880
producers yes it was like oh we gotta
and especially in canada when you had in

761
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.000
canada in the 90s when you had
children's programming there was a

762
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.680
compulsory amount of time that you
needed to take after each episode or

763
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.559
during each episode to explain the
morality of the things for the kids

764
00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:34.480
um which magic school bus didn't really
need that because it had it within the

765
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.839
script of the show but like for things
like sailor moon which was a little bit

766
00:51:37.839 --> 00:51:40.240
more nuanced
um

767
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.359
compared to mad school bus uh you did
need that kind of section at the end of

768
00:51:43.359 --> 00:51:47.119
the show in order for it to be aired uh
for kids

769
00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:52.319
um pokemon didn't need it because once
again it was within the text of the show

770
00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:56.400
dragon ball z didn't have it that wasn't
kids programming or at least wasn't sold

771
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.680
is it
yeah it was more sold as like

772
00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:03.280
teenage yeah so there needed to be that
compulsory educational component of it

773
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.800
yeah um
so it's funny that you messed up what

774
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.200
sailor moon says um so yeah that's
that's kind of where i've been gathering

775
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.240
that from um

776
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:19.760
i'm not sure if it had a american if the
amer if it was in america but i knew

777
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.079
that wasn't what it was in canada
but then again the sailor moon abridged

778
00:52:24.079 --> 00:52:29.200
series um also had sailor moon says in
it at the end of every abridged episode

779
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:35.040
did it really yeah yeah
and remember sailor moon says

780
00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:39.599
so yeah it must have been in the
american side too because i remember

781
00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:42.960
america had a lot of
kind of strict

782
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.720
um
stuff for what could be shown to kids

783
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.160
after
or no i think that was before reagan

784
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.119
because then reagan got rid of some
policies i remember what's her what's

785
00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:58.400
her face um something
al gore's wife

786
00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:04.160
she
crusaded for the kids oh i know um in

787
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:08.319
ways she wanted to get rid of like
entire bands she wanted like half of

788
00:53:08.319 --> 00:53:11.280
music just deleted from the world she
would have preferred children didn't

789
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.079
exist i think

790
00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:19.040
i love that in the discussion about
whether we're going to have censorship

791
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.839
of music whether we were going to
basically just ban certain kinds of

792
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:26.720
music uh you had all of these big stars
coming in like you know like um

793
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.570
american american people
and they

794
00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:33.040
[Laughter]
they went in with their american rock

795
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.520
star look and their leather jackets and
their long hair

796
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:42.880
um not frank zappa frank zappa got a
haircut he shaved and he went in a suit

797
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.119
and he explained it and he explained the
reasons why this censorship will lead to

798
00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:51.440
a larger problem with censorship of all
media at that point though like in the

799
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.880
late 80s frank zappa had been kind of
fathered in as the the dad yeah in the

800
00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.079
music industry kind of because he's one
of those people that was like so

801
00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:03.680
incredibly influential but no one's ever
heard of him um and it's just because

802
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.400
like
if you like he influenced everyone you

803
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.520
have heard of yeah yeah that's that's
how it works with a lot of musicians is

804
00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.640
like you know like uh they kind of go
underground but because they're like

805
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.559
really brilliant at what they do frank
nacho bass sinatra frank zappa basically

806
00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:20.319
nobody's heard of frank sinatra frank
zappa basically wrote chamber music uh

807
00:54:20.319 --> 00:54:22.960
and sent it to a rock band yeah that's
what he did for a lot of his

808
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.119
compositions um
valley girl that's kind of it

809
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:34.079
was like so bitchin there's like the
galleria

810
00:54:35.119 --> 00:54:39.440
i love the story for that song too but
yeah like uh he kind of went in with his

811
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.359
suit and his haircut cause like he was
renowned for being you know like having

812
00:54:43.359 --> 00:54:47.680
very long shaggy hair and he he cleaned
himself up and he went in and he talked

813
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.920
about censorship
and that's what swayed the um special

814
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:57.520
interest board of con on congress yeah
uh i i just love that that is this um

815
00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.920
obscure
yet well-regarded rock singer

816
00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.400
rock star
who who is um brilliant enough to influ

817
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.400
for everyone whose life was music for
them to have heard of but uh too

818
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.760
brilliant for people to really for
general audiences to really appreciate

819
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:19.520
and i hope now these many years later
that those politicians feel shame

820
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.760
for their
bullshittery that they tried to pull off

821
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.240
in the early 90s and late 80s do you
remember music and video games and books

822
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.960
they remember they tried to get
goosebumps banned oh my god i hadn't

823
00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:35.599
argued with my mom because my mom's like
no there is actually um scientific

824
00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:39.440
evidence psychological evidence showing
that video games erode empathy and i'm

825
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.559
like
congratulations mom you know how to read

826
00:55:42.559 --> 00:55:45.200
facebook um
[Music]

827
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.400
the most empathetic people i know are
gamers

828
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.319
i know but my mom's kind of stuck to her
things and i don't really feel like

829
00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:55.040
arguing most of the time
um

830
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:59.359
oh my god she started some [ __ ] anyway
uh anyway

831
00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:03.839
my mom ladies and gentlemen um

832
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:10.000
yeah uh so yeah one thing i love about
like old congress is watching mr rogers

833
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.480
go in
and talk to congress about the

834
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.400
importance of pbs and
why it's so important to have that kind

835
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.240
of public programming
and having the politicians on the board

836
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.680
and the committee actually listen
and engage with him

837
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.040
yeah and listen instead of what they do
now when you have like someone coming

838
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.960
into for a hearing they just they're on
their phones they're on their phones or

839
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.200
they're just there to get their sound
bites in

840
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.200
they're not there to actually have a
discussion and talk about you know

841
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.640
whether or not
something

842
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.960
should be i mean politics is a mess
right now in this particular point in

843
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.680
history
i mean i think politics have always been

844
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.799
a mess i think they're getting i think
it's getting messier i i think the

845
00:56:50.799 --> 00:56:54.319
problem
is that the people who are being elected

846
00:56:54.319 --> 00:56:58.720
are wannabe celebrities
instead of

847
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.119
like people who actually start because
like you have the people like aoc where

848
00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:06.559
she's kind of like a classic politician
where they started out kind of doing

849
00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:10.400
like community organizing and stuff like
that because even the likes of like

850
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.000
nancy pelosi and stuff who are like so
out of touch now when they first got

851
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.280
into politics it was they got into
politics for a reason

852
00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:21.920
whereas when you have these people like
ted cruz or marley marjorie taylor green

853
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.760
or these people they want to be the next
donald trump that's why they're in

854
00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.000
depaul they're they're political
influencers

855
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.680
yeah basically
um i like where she get told

856
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.480
um
but

857
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.920
and i think that's the problem now is
that so many politicians on the left and

858
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.720
the right
not trying to both sides it but on the

859
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.359
left and the right are just trying to
gain influence well i think donald trump

860
00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:49.200
especially kind of eroded that because
when he became president when he was

861
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.839
running you had like people like the
rock saying like i'm gonna run for

862
00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:54.880
president yeah and you have a whole
bunch of people on the left being like

863
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.720
i'm gonna run for president and it's
like what right kanye west um at one

864
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.400
point uh said i'm running for president
he might still might i don't know who

865
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:08.559
knows depends on the week um
who's that guy uh bob iger

866
00:58:08.559 --> 00:58:12.079
he wants to run for president
yeah see that's the thing though with

867
00:58:12.079 --> 00:58:14.240
like

868
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.040
sorry unplugged my headphones sorry
sorry now i can't hear anything sorry

869
00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.119
i just shifted because i plugged them
back in sure fine you were closer i

870
00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:29.839
think i know i wasn't
but um

871
00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:32.559
i hope that didn't mess up the recording
are the numbers still going up our

872
00:58:32.559 --> 00:58:35.280
number stunks

873
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.880
stunks okay
um

874
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.480
that's the thing with like bob iger is
like

875
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.160
you could argue
that he actually

876
00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.720
did
take a corporation that was

877
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.480
when he got control of it
and made it into the biggest corporation

878
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.599
in the world but here's the case like
the biggest media company

879
00:58:57.599 --> 00:59:00.319
but
just let me finish okay

880
00:59:00.319 --> 00:59:03.760
and the democrats
don't have

881
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.119
a
business person they have a lot of

882
00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:11.599
people who are owned by big business but
they don't have anyone who has run a big

883
00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:14.160
business
um

884
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:18.799
and you know he could be
the democrats argument of

885
00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:23.280
well here's our business person he knows
how to run the economy

886
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.119
and oh by the way he's also the one who
started gay days at disneyland and he's

887
00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:31.760
the one who started um
you know all of these

888
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.440
stuff he's you know
other than you know unions he's very

889
00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:40.160
progressive on social issues
and so you kind of have the ooh business

890
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.960
i like him i'll vote for him at the same
time that he's not the devil

891
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.359
yeah um
like he has done interviews now where

892
00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:52.240
he's basically like bob chapic's a
[ __ ] dick

893
00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:58.000
i can't believe this like
i'm so glad i left when i did kind of

894
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.280
thing i mean this wouldn't be happening
if you had hadn't left but yeah but he

895
01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.200
wants to run for president yeah
and everyone knows joe biden's not gonna

896
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:09.200
make it and here's the thing when
someone runs for president it's like

897
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.280
why do you want to do that
yeah like do you want to help people or

898
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.240
do you want that on your resume do you
want a feather in your cap cause like

899
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.559
you know what's up for grabs these days
it seems like yeah like i wholeheartedly

900
01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:24.319
think hillary clinton was running for
president specifically to be the first

901
01:00:24.319 --> 01:00:28.480
woman president i don't think she had an
agenda i think that was her goal that

902
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.040
was her kit that was her campaign that
was her marketing i'm with her it was

903
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.640
all focused around being the first woman
president and any time it came to policy

904
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.599
and the troops and the flag troops uh
whereas i think like in 2008 obama

905
01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:46.720
actually had like stuff he wanted to get
done

906
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.960
um but was then absorbed into the
democratic machine which he actually

907
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.839
admits to in his in his uh biography
yeah

908
01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:59.599
um and i think biden is another one like
clinton where he just wanted he felt

909
01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:03.040
like it was his turn yeah to be
president he didn't have any grant even

910
01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.240
though like he could look at it as i'm
only gonna have one term because i'm so

911
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.559
old i could do the biggest changes in
america and be remembered and be

912
01:01:10.559 --> 01:01:15.920
remembered yeah and then let them fight
let them let like i'll do an executive

913
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.280
order where everyone has free health
care and let them fight it in the courts

914
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.880
yeah um and this is why i'm not opposed
to legacy presidents like presidents who

915
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.240
want to leave a lasting legacy like
because it's like you're going to do

916
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.920
stuff if you want legacy it's probably
going to be on the progressive side

917
01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.400
because people who do unprogressive [ __ ]
don't get remembered well they do i mean

918
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.160
reagan is remembered for
losing his mind in the last couple of

919
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:44.319
years nixon is remembered for lying um
george w bush is remembered for starting

920
01:01:44.319 --> 01:01:48.240
a forever that's not legacy that's being
remembered uh like there's like these

921
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.799
president reagan had to let
reagan had a legacy in terms of just

922
01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:57.039
like just a good one not a good one no
uh nixon had the epa

923
01:01:57.039 --> 01:02:00.000
nixon had the epa which is basically
gone now because of trump yeah but

924
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.720
people also don't remember that nixon
also

925
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.200
um
opened up relations with china but

926
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.599
people yeah because that's that that's
not relevant anymore people remember fdr

927
01:02:09.599 --> 01:02:13.680
um
well fdr has like multiple legacies you

928
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.319
know
he won world war ii he got the america

929
01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:21.440
out of the depression he was the only
person to ever be elected four times um

930
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.559
he was the only person who ever picked
us a an outs out note socialist for his

931
01:02:26.559 --> 01:02:30.000
vice president
like and no no no no no no no no no who

932
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.200
got replaced by truman at the democratic
convention yeah because they knew that

933
01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.160
fdr was gonna die soon they didn't want
a socialist to be president so they

934
01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.359
replaced him with someone without a high
school diploma but people don't even

935
01:02:39.359 --> 01:02:42.480
remember truman
like you know he dropped the bomb that's

936
01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.319
yeah that's all he did but people don't
really credit him with that though

937
01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:49.839
no because the bomb wasn't developed
under truman that was developed under

938
01:02:49.839 --> 01:02:52.880
but if you want to talk about legacy
nobody remembers the presence from the

939
01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.240
20s they were all republicans

940
01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:59.280
uh
one of them was obsessed with the shape

941
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.400
of skulls
phrenology i can't remember his name

942
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.079
though not surprised i mean most people
can't remember most american presidents

943
01:03:06.079 --> 01:03:09.680
it's jfk
fdr

944
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:16.400
uh lincoln washington and the the new
ones yeah

945
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:22.000
like who was president right before jfk
wasn't that

946
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.559
eisenhower
i think it might have been eisenhower

947
01:03:24.559 --> 01:03:28.240
but like eisenhower another one who had
a legacy because of socialist leanings

948
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.359
even though he was a republican yeah he
was a republican he desegregated the

949
01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:35.599
schools yeah
did he yep no no no it wasn't fairly

950
01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:39.119
certain he did no it was the president
after him that desegregated the schools

951
01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.760
that was
no it was the president after kennedy it

952
01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.559
was johnson
desegregated the schools okay i think

953
01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:50.880
i thought it was eisenhower no it would
because that was the 50s yeah okay i i

954
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.359
was really surprised because i knew it
was a republican president who did

955
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.480
oh i don't know yeah
i don't know

956
01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.839
we're canadian we don't need to know
this yeah

957
01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:05.520
we didn't
we didn't have segregation we just had

958
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.799
did we
no um maybe we did

959
01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:12.599
we just had you know

960
01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.799
something else that i don't want to talk
about yeah north american history i

961
01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:20.720
don't want to talk about it yeah
it's just a lot of sad

962
01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:27.119
but it was uh oh frick i forgot the
exact title now what uh regional schools

963
01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:30.960
residential schools yeah look up canada
residential schools if you ever want to

964
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.000
feel good about being american
um

965
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.280
i mean we also had japanese internment
camps but then against america did we

966
01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.359
yeah in the world or two japanese david
suzuki lived in one i did not know that

967
01:04:41.359 --> 01:04:44.319
his family was removed from the store
they owned and put in a residential and

968
01:04:44.319 --> 01:04:49.280
not a residence um an internment camp
during world war ii know that yep

969
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.839
yep how did i not know that
uh because the canadian government finds

970
01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:56.559
that embarrassing

971
01:04:56.799 --> 01:05:00.799
um
so yeah um

972
01:05:00.799 --> 01:05:04.640
which they feel shame
for that honestly when we just at the

973
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.000
discussion we had about political
influencers and that stuff i think a big

974
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.559
problem with the world is that people on
mass do not feel enough guilt and shame

975
01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:16.000
yes like you ever see white people
dancing that's the result of a lack of

976
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.799
guilt and shame
um

977
01:05:18.799 --> 01:05:24.400
and i have seen a white person dancing
in my lifetime uh now and then

978
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.880
yeah
there are two people two races who are

979
01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.880
allowed to dance
people who are of african descent

980
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.280
and people from korea that's it south
korea i don't think north koreans know

981
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.760
how to dance latin america son
oh yeah boy yeah

982
01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.640
just not white people

983
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.559
white people are not allowed to dance
you give white people permission to

984
01:05:48.559 --> 01:05:52.000
dance and they have that weird russian
kicking dance thing oh yeah like and

985
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.280
it's like and that's not a big thing
like there's a lot of like in white

986
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.119
expression or like white upgrading it's
like we need to make sure that everyone

987
01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:02.960
is unrestricted and feels no shame in
what they do and it's like maybe if you

988
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.240
had a bit of shame you could correct bad
dance moves

989
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.960
and kind of influence them to be a
little bit less wooden when they're

990
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.920
moving their body
and

991
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.520
um
just calling robin sing it all over the

992
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.270

we we appreciate and we love you

1012
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:44.000
and i feel so bad that we missed a week
of the patreon patreon because

1013
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.119
because
nick don't be no so nonchalant you never

1014
01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:52.160
know i'm not being nonchalant i'm just
saying like i i like to be very taoist

1015
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.720
about these things and the more you try
and make something happen the less the

1016
01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.760
more it kind of gets away from you you
know

1017
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.839
see i'm very much of the opinion that if
you don't try and make something happen

1018
01:08:03.839 --> 01:08:06.960
it never will
there's some nuance with endowed with

1019
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.559
him about that it's basically just like
okay you you want to be a you're a

1020
01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:15.119
circle but you want to be a square it's
never going to happen but you could you

1021
01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:18.560
can be
what you can be is the best circle you

1022
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.040
can be the best circle that's something
you can be an oval okay you can force

1023
01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.440
yourself into being an oval i'm also of
the currently trying to force myself out

1024
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:33.199
of a circle into oval
eating not much i'm also of the opinion

1025
01:08:33.199 --> 01:08:37.920
that uh desperation stinks
so like you know people kind of pick up

1026
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:44.080
on it so like you know
we're going for chill vibes here so like

1027
01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.440
i just want everyone to know they're
appreciated they are appreciated but i

1028
01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.120
also want them to know that you don't
need to feel pressured because they're

1029
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.839
lovely
and things are going fine well i don't

1030
01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:58.880
think they feel pressure
i feel pressure

1031
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.799
a lot of pressure
but he was trying to get you to relax a

1032
01:09:02.799 --> 01:09:07.839
little bit so that your creative juices
can flow easier

1033
01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:11.920
what is relax what's that it's a word i
don't know

1034
01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.759
i just feel it sometimes i don't know
we need massages we should get massages

1035
01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:19.600
yeah
i've only had one massage and that was

1036
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.520
when i threw my back out i've never had
one and that might be why my back is so

1037
01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.440
sore all the time
um so anyway yeah so

1038
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.960
the end of this episode of the padreon
we'll be back next week with a whole new

1039
01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.319
episode of stuff hopefully not just feed
into an episode about self-care

1040
01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:39.199
hopefully not as dour as this one well
we had some upper moments um

1041
01:09:39.199 --> 01:09:44.640
talking about guilt and shame
and we never talked about the catholics

1042
01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.719
uh we're both catholic though so i think
that's taken for granted catholic light

1043
01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:53.679
catholic light so thank you for
