The Don’t Say Gay Bill is a piece of crap education bill in Florida, the intention of which is to outlaw all discussions surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. <mark>Florida House Bill 1557 was introduced in the state House of Representatives</mark> in January, <mark>while an identical version, called the Senate Bill 1834,</mark> (I assume these bills are named after the year each political body thinks we still live in) <mark>advanced in the state Senate</mark>. 

<mark>Both bills, titled ‘Parental Rights in Education’, ban classroom discussions about sexuality and gender identity in</mark> (quote) <mark>“primary grade levels”</mark>, but <mark>does not specify</mark> exactly what a “primary grade level” is, let alone which <mark>age bracket</mark> it defines.

Contrast to a bill about parking regulation, <span class="add">say,</span> which will be three-hundred pages long, include every foreseeable caveat and exception to the bill, and include a thrown-in clause about lawn maintenance in a single cul de sac within one of the signer’s municipal districts. Especially in America, bills are usually *incredibly* specific, because the public and law enforcement (in theory) need to know the limits of their legal authority. 

Descriminatory bills *usually* do not have limits because the governing authorities want to provide as much leeway for further discrimination as possible. It’s less about generating a mandate for civil action and more about removing restrictions on existing bigoted people, and validating their biogtry with political authority.

This is curious as the language of this bill is directed at giving parents ‘more control’ over their families. However, the mandate of the bill is to dictate what is and is not appropriate in public. Which, contrary to the language, targets parents who *do* support their queer children, and brands them as being unfit, or as fostering ‘inappropreate’ social attitudes among their children. Therefore, the public may interpret this as the supportive parents of queer-children *themselves*, being social delinquants. And that they deserve whatever consequences may come their way. 

This bill promises freedom for parents… as long as they conform to a specific kind of freedom. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and a favorite for the 2024 Republican nomination for president, said that it was “entirely inappropriate” for teachers to be having conversations with students about gender identity. He also said: 

> “Schools need to be teaching kids to read, to write. They need to teach them science, history. We need more civics and understanding of the US Constitution, what makes our country unique, all those basic stuff.” 

Yes he said “all those basic stuff”

And we know Florida school books aren't exactly prime real estate for truthful depictions of, *say,* the war of Northern Aggression, now don’t we? Anyway. 

On February 25th this passed through the Florida House of Representatives, on its way to quickly becoming law. President Joe Biden, or someone on his team (more likely), quickly tweeted: 

\[Tweet displayed on screen:]

> “I want every member of the LGBTQI+ community — especially the kids who will be impacted by this hateful bill — to know that you are loved and accepted just as you are. I have your back, and my Administration will continue to fight for the protections and safety you deserve.”

Side note: it’s been theorized that Igre<sup class="add">[sic: Iger]</sup> intends on running for president as a democrat in the near future so he doesn’t want to get on the bad side of any gays right now. And this is true to form for democrats who use social outrage to signal that they’re on the right side of history. Whereas if Iger actually wanted to make a *difference*, there is a lot he could do that would be more substantial than tweeting the equivalent of ‘that goes for me, but double.’ Like… spend some of his hundreds of millions of dollars on supporting young LGBTQ people he’s so worried about.

But here’s the rub. Bob Chapek, the *current* CEO and Chairman of Disney said *nothing*. The only thing that came out with his name even *associated* with it was that milk toast<sup class="add">[sic: milquetoast]</sup> non-statement I read at the beginning of the video. You see, Chapek’s been busy putting his own stamp on Disney corporate culture, and is clearly less willing than even Igre<sup class="add">[sic: Iger]</sup> to advocate for, you know, human rights causes.

For example, The Hollywood Reporter… reported that <mark>a knowledgeable source</mark> at Disney has said that <mark>Chapek balked at the idea of weighing in on</mark> <span class="del">even</span> fighting over <span class="add">even</span> <mark>voting rights</mark> in Florida. Quote:

<mark>this anonymous person said.</mark> 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.hollywood_reporter at="¶ 4" %}>

These suggestions overlook the fact that Iger had exited Disney at the end of December, as well as the reality that his relationship with Chapek had clearly become strained after Iger took the title of chairman emeritus and Chapek became CEO in February 2020. More importantly, Chapek is busy putting his own stamp on Disney company culture, and clearly he will be less willing to wade into advocacy than Iger. For example, <mark>a knowledgeable source</mark> says <mark>Chapek balked at a proposal to weigh in on</mark> <mark>voting rights</mark>.

Chapek is private about his politics but is believed to be much more conservative than Iger, who was a registered Democrat before becoming an independent in 2016. <mark>“Chapek is staunchly opposed to bringing Disney into issues he deems irrelevant to the company and its businesses,” this person says.</mark>

Which is a massive problem because Disney brings a lot, and I mean A LOT of money into Florida, so if Disney were to threaten to pack up it’s east-coast theme park and leave the sunshine state if certain bills were passed, that could significantly impact political decisions in that state. 

They did that when Georgia was messing around with these kinds of bills, since most Disney movies are now shot in Atlanta, and the state backtracked on its own hateful political agenda real fast. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.hollywood_reporter at="¶ 7" %}>

During his years at Disney, Iger chose his battles and his words. But he weighed in on some hot-button issues. In 2019, he told Reuters that if Georgia passed a controversial “heartbeat bill” that sought to ban abortions about six weeks into pregnancy, it would be “very difficult” for Disney to continue to film productions in the state. “I think many people who work for us will not want to work there, and we will have to heed their wishes in that regard,” he said. (The Georgia bill was signed into law but has been tied up in court battles since.)

In all this discussion about raising awareness for gay rights, it’s like everyone stopped listening after the ‘awareness’ part. A whole lot of good awareness does when it comes to laws that *explicitly* target us — and now our parents. The ones who actually care about us! Because the lawmakers are sure AWARE we exist now! 

And Florida is not alone in this renewed crusade against queer kids. Dozens of laws have popped up across the country trying to keep any gender or sexuality confirming language out of schools. Including a widespread book ban that, although took a chainsaw approach, famously banning books like *Maus* from classrooms, also took out any LGBTQ focused or inclusive books they could find as well.

Which, given that medical professionals are — professionally — heald<sup class="add">[sic: held]</sup> to confidentiality, even in instances where someone has been murdered, these lawmakers seem to be asking doctors to choose between their medical licence and fines or prison. 

Where else have you been legally required to report people who are doing things that the dear leader has a personal problem with? You know what? Don’t even answer that.

<mark>But the message is crystal clear</mark>.

I realize a lot of people have rose-tinted nostalgia goggles when it comes to disney, and I myself enjoy a lot of the content, but as a corporation, their primary priority is their *stockholders*. Not their audience, not their employees, not their legacy. And the stockholders don’t seem to have a problem with this corporation (that produces children's media) supporting politicians who support legislation that targets and discriminates against children. 

I can say that all we have to do is target Disney’s profits in response to this to drive down revenue which would negatively impact dividends… the shareholders would then hold an emergency meeting and the board of directors would put pressure on Chapek to do… something?

The nihilist in me just kinda wants to shrug and say ‘well… can you really expect anything better from a soulless corporation?’ In fact the nihilist in me becomes more and more significant the more this happens. Because every step we take to that whole… be the change you want to see in the world — ends up being a door in the face. It’s easier to keep your head down and move along. Scrape by however you can manage. 

But for some people, being able to ‘scrape by’ is a best-case scenario. Let’s say you have a relatively open-minded population. Or at least, a population for whom the majority are ambivalent, but who exist in a cultural zeitgeist where the ethical code is geared towards morality and community-building. Let’s also say that there is a fraction of the national political body who, for the sake of perpetuating their *actual* agenda, target specific groups to destabilize, distract, and disenfranchise.

If this moral population is able to make ends meet comfortably, they will naturally demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the discriminatory practices. However, take this same population, and over-work it to the point of chronic burnout. This population now exists in a situation where it is nearly impossible for large groups to make a living without working multiple jobs, or working too much at one job. 

They are crushed under a successful workplace propaganda effort that workers rights are detrimental to a worker’s income, and where the only valid work ethic is to work as much as humanly possible. Between work, family, and kids, are they going to have the time or energy to actively participate in political discourse? Looking south from over the border,[^canada] I’m honestly surprised — and impressed — that as many people in Florida and Texas have showed up to stand against these bigoted laws as they have. 

[^canada]: As in looking at America from Canada, where James was based.

Right-wing lawmakers have an invested interest in limiting the number of people who benefit from widespread social rights. The less groups of people who are politically ‘valid’ — the easier it is to develop consistent propaganda to manipulate these people.

And also generating a horde of exploitable labor from the underclass. That last part is key. <mark>Because, a fun fact that lives in my head rent-free is that, at its peak, roughly 70% of the Roman Empire’s population… were not Roman citizens.</mark> They were slaves. Slaves, and freed slaves, throughout the empire’s domination, made up the bulk of what we now consider to be ‘the Roman people.’ 

That other 30% — and an even smaller fraction was actually the socially superior ‘Patrician’ class — required a legion of slavery in order for society to function. So if we’re still sitting around wondering why we can’t all just get along, it’s because a collection of social superiors NEED an underclass in order for their lives to function. Costs of labor cut into profits. And if slavery is ‘illegal’ — except for instances of mass-incerceration — the next best thing is to make it as cheap as possible to exploit someone. 

And someone is easier to exploit if the government is consistently de-valuing their identity and their selves. What right do you have to ask for a living wage if the government itself has deemed you as not being suitable to exist?

Meanwhile, non-queer-people can’t seem to understand WHY suicide is still highest per-capita among queer youth, specifically queer trans youth. You know what they need? MORE AWARENESS. That’s all they need. More awareness. 

[Doing a 'Susan' impression:] Why are there all these suicides? Haven’t all of these depressed queer kids seen the rainbow logos every June? Haven’t they seen all the gays Disney’s been putting in movies? Like that one in Cruella, or Beauty and the Beast, or Jungle Cruise. I mean they never said they were gay in the movie but still. OH, and that guy from the Eternals. I didn’t go see it but I’m sure these LBGTABC kids did. Don’t they know they’re being seen? I’m doing MY part! I watch Queer-Eye on Netflix! 

The objective of these laws is not to erase queer people.

These laws are not to erase queer people, it’s to make our lives as difficult as humanly possible so that the upper-echelons of our society have a chronically refreshed underclass of people that they can *exploit*. And nobody’s more in need of an exploitable labor pool like a corporation with a theme park. 

Even though lawmakers and CEOs and billionaires may not really have a problem with queer people, in order to have an easily available desperate underclass who will be (presumably) grateful to work whatever job they’re given, they require the public at large to put as much social pressure on this group as possible. 

And when it comes to corporations and their apparent support of rights, their silence is in their best interest. Because it is them who benefit from the underclasses. The more people are persecuted, and the more severe that persecution, the less they have to actually do to turn around and trumpet how progressive they are. They give us less, they pay us less, and we’re grateful because ‘LGBTQIA-Friendly cooperation to the rescue!’ All the while indirectly supporting our persecution because ‘tax breaks’ — or worse, being entirely indifferent to our suffering and trying to turn around and make a buck off us anyway.

We’re not a community to them, we’re a sponge that they can squeeze anything out of. Cheap labor, grateful for the opportunity to work in a place where our coworkers won’t spit on us? They got that.

Without competition to see who can make the best queer content, we’re sitting at the wrong end of half a dozen monopolies of hetero-hegimonistic CEOs and billionares who think they have the right to decide what we want. Because they’ve been systematically eliminating — not only our options — but our very rights and dignities. 

They’ve got this lie going where they want us to think that we need them. That we have no other option but to support them because who else are we going to support.

So in spite of the fact that these ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bills may end up being toothless or, struck down by higher courts, and that there may be no way to actually enforce them, they are projecting to the public at large that their anti-trans and anti-gay laws are not bigotry — they are the right way to be an American. That people who feel that ‘cis’ is a slur against non-trans people have the backing of, at least, the state government. 

These are laws to embolden people who were already bigoted, or to coerce people who were indifferent. Or maybe who knows? There’s gonna be an anti-queer gestapo with state funding turning up soon.

It would be very easy for Disney to come out and say “We oppose what the state legislature is proposing in Florida and we may not renew our certain land leases within the state”. 

It’s an empty threat, because Disney would never <span class="add">actually</span> abandon Walt Disney World in Orlando, but that’s 77,000 people who would lose their jobs at Disney if the state goes through with these draconian hateful laws. That’s 77,000 people who would be activated to stop these laws from being passed. Just say the words Disney. 

I’m not asking for gay superheroes this time. We got one, and he was awesome. I’m not asking for a gay prince charming. I’m not asking for a trans disney princess. I’m asking you to say “No.” when these vicious politicians say “You can’t say gay, but you sure as hell can say hate.” You can say “no”. You can say “We say gay” like these kids did. They have more balls than your billion dollar corporation and your heartless CEO. Tell the state you’ll pull your business out of there. 

Do something. For Christ sake, with everything going on in the world right now you have the power to make SOME peoples lives a little bit easier. Or, Jesus, at least not harder than they already are. Queer kids, even with the most loving families, still live in fear in the best of times. So show them that you’ve got their backs. That you actually do care about families. That the money from those goddamn rainbow mickey ears we all buy actually goes to doing something to help instead of just feeding donations to hateful politicians who will give you your goddamn tax breaks.
