Having made a few videos about queer coding and representation in movies, I've gotten a lot of feedback from a lot of different people. But one comment that I see over and over and over again is something like this:

<u>[Video blurs and quote shown on screen, James reads in artificial high pitched voice]:</u>

> "This was never meant to be gay. You're just reading into it too much"

...or...

<u>[Video blurs again and quote shown on screen, James reads in artificial low pitched voice]:</u>

> "You're reaching pretty far to find anything queer about this"

And so I decided that people are *woefully* undereducated on film theory, which is -- as we know -- the most important subject you could ever study in school. Because if these people leaving these comments knew what film theory was, they'd know what Queer Theory is.

<james {% include timecode %}>

<mark>"Film theory" discusses the essence of cinema and provides conceptual frameworks for understanding a film's relationship to reality, other arts, individual viewers, and society as a whole.

<h2>FILM THEORY</h2>

<mark>Film theory debates the essence of the cinema and provides conceptual frameworks for understanding film's relationship to reality, the other arts, individual viewers, and society at large. This term is not to be confused with film analysis, a way of analyzing film, which may draw upon ideas from film theory.</mark>

<h2>FILM ANALYSIS</h2>
<mark>Film anaylysis<sup class="add">[sic: analysis]</sup> is the process in which a film is analyzed in terms of mise-en-scène, montage, cinematography, sound, and editing.</mark> One way of analyzing films is by the shot-by-shot analysis, though that is typically used only for small clips or scenes.

<mark>As the new art form of the twentieth century, film immediately</mark> and continuously <mark>invited theoretical attempts to define its nature and function.

<!-- Footage here is of a bunch of early silent films. -->

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Writers, directors, producers, and critics wanted to slap a philosophical academic lens onto movies so that they could be held in the same esteem as theater, and the novel. However, much of coding in film, especially queer coding, is rooted in film language itself.</span>

And "film language" refers to conventions and patterns in lighting, sound, and visual elements that reinforce the narrative structure. This doesn't necessarily refer to elements of the narrative itself, like something written into the script or an actor's performance. These elements are usually more subtle.

They're used to change the moods or attitudes of a scene highlight, a recurring theme of the film, or convey an unspoken message that the director is trying to get across. That last part is important for queer coding; go watch [my videos on "gaybaiting"](Unrequited1.md) for more on that.

<james {% include timecode %}>

You can see clear examples of lighting used as film language in *Avengers: Infinity War*, where scenes lit with purple highlight Thanos's influence and cruelty. And scenes lit with orange are in resistance to him. *The Last Jedi* -- the absolute best *Star Wars* movie of all time, we can all agree on that -- very deliberately depicts objects being split apart. This can speak to the content of fractured alliances within the movie itself, the divided nature of the fan base as a whole, or making a meta self-aware statement of the director's knowledge of the film's own divisive content.

James pulls from another video essay for his B-Roll here. He uses the opening montage, cutting away to not include that video's title. According to that video's subtitles (which it uses to actually *cite* its sources), the following films are shown in James's video: *American Beauty* (1999), *Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind* (2004), *The Tree of Life* (2011), *Melancholia* (2011), *Ida* (2013), *Gravity* (2013), *Only God Forgives* (2013), *Antichrist* (2009), *Fargo* (1996), *The Good, The Bad and The Ugly* (1966), *12 Years A Slave* (2013), *Raging Bull* (1980), *Barry Lyndon* (1975).

<u>[On screen next to James]: "Structuralist Film Theory"</u>

The shoot-out that ends Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western "Dollars" trilogy is a valid example of how these elements work together to produce an effect: The shot selection goes from very wide to very close and tense; the length of shots decreases as the sequence progresses towards its end; the music builds. All of these elements, in combination rather than individually, create tension. Formalism is unique in that it embraces both ideological and auteurist branches of criticism. In both these cases, the common denominator for Formalist criticism is style.

So it's clear that there are many ways of examining film in a critical way. not one school of film theory can fully describe a complete understanding of film itself. So, for using theory in film criticism, a critic usually has to state which theory they're drawing from. This goes to say, however, that film can be criticized with pre-existing schools of thought, like with Marxism and Feminism. In both of these cases, scholars and critics took certain tenants of these studies and applied them to an analysis of film. So if there is a Marxist and Feminist reading of cinema, why not a queer one?

<h2>Queer Theory</h2>

<mark>Originating in the early 1990s,</mark> <mark>queer theory comprises a diverse body of intellectual inquiry. It</mark> takes as its premise the notion <mark>that specific psychological, political, and cultural codes have elevated heterosexuality to the status of a sexual "given."</mark> By revealing these codes and exposing their limitations, along with the unstable foundations upon which they operate and sustain their power, queer theory aims to "undo" the heterosexual norm, and to extend the power of cultural presence and voice to sexually marginalized groups who do not adhere to the workings of heteronormativity. A "queer" perspective, then, is attentive to a multiplicity of sexual codes that operate in the products of cultural institutions, and does not privilege heterosexual codes as natural or authoritative. The designation of "queer" is itself a form of empowerment, through which a disenfranchised subculture has taken charge of a term that dominant heterosexual culture has used historically as a derogatory label. 

</from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Social rewards are provided for queers who can pass. Certain opportunities and privileges are awarded to queer folks who seem to have assimilated into the straight expectations and values. This includes things like--

<u>[Appearing on screen as he speaks them]:</u>

--<q>Marriage</q>, <q>Parenthood</q>, <q>Settling Down</q> at X years old, <q>Moving to the Suburbs</q>, and fulfilling various traditions the society has--

<u>[The last one is presented on-screen as "Being Basic as Fuck".]</u>

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<james {% include timecode %}>

This is called "heteronormativity" and it's the most intellectual way that you can call a bitch basic. By exposing the limitations of heteronormative conditioning and taking advantage of the culturally performative aspects of gender, the aim of Queer Theory is to draw a distinction between the individual and the formative processes that influence gender and sexuality. It's not to say that it's bad to be straight, but instead Queer Theory looks at all sexuality and gender as being neutral and questions why weight and preference are given to some while others are seen as abnormal. 

Queer Theory is not only the analysis of codes and conditioning associated with heteronormativity, but more recently is being extended to discuss and document the interactions of queer people in their own communities. A queer perspective then is looking at a vast array of sexual codes that exist in culture, and does not privilege heterosexual codes as natural or authoritative. The designation of queer is itself a form of empowerment through which a disenfranchised subculture has taken charge of a term that the straights have used historically as a derogatory label. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Theorists vary in their configurations on which groups and perspectives are included under the blanket of "queer film theory". Many theorists find any challenge to the normative nature of heterosexuality to qualify as queer, such as the non-traditional family at the end of aliens, while others use the term to apply specifically to gender and sexual orientations that challenge or complicate the presumed alliance between sexual identity and gender identity.

This isn't to say that a queer reading is one that requires us to see a certain character as queer coded. A queer reading can examine the ways in which the narratives, themes, and language of a film reinforce and exemplify heteronormative values. For instance, the film *Cordelia* is a period horror movie. However... you wouldn't know it from the movie's poster. A wave of queer eyebrows were raised, unsure as to what about the movie's poster was supposed to be so... scary. The messaging in this poster is that the horror here is a dominant woman and a submissive man. To everyone outside the hetero hegemony, this just looks like a good time.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Queerness doesn't even need to be present in a film to derive a queer reading from it. Just like there can be a feminist reading of *Reservoir Dogs*, where there are almost no female characters, by examining the way patriarchal masculinity factors into the depictions of each character. 

There can also be a queer reading of *Kill Bill*, my favorite movie. There are no openly queer characters in the film, and for characters who might be queer, their queerness is not at all encoded in the language of the film. However, the bride, when she realized that she was pregnant, immediately wanted to leave behind her atypical chosen family. Instead of raising her daughter among a group of cutthroat assassins, she wanted a better life by forcing herself into the most heteronormative family that she could find on short notice. Because growing up poor in El Paso, Texas, is *so* much better than growing up around rich assassins.

It is this rejection of non-conformity which sends her life into ruins, and spurs the whole bloody affair into action. (And, yes, Hattori Hanzō is totally gay.)

In essence, Queer Theory is watching a film through a queer lens, reading the film as queer whether it was meant to be or not. Finding a way to see art in a queer way.

Even before Queer Theory, we would watch a play or a movie and see a character, and we would look at them and say what they're going through is a queer experience, intended or not. That's easy to do with some movies. The queer subtext in *A Nightmare On Elm Street: Part Two* is so obvious the straight people readily picked it up. The lesbian energy in *Dracula's Daughter*, the bisexual tension erupting from *Rebel Without A Cause*, even the relationship between Captain America and Bucky Barnes was read as gay by *millions* of straight movie goers.

Media that attracts a queer reading is usually produced by straight people, with no intention on being read as queer. But the LGBT population, so starved for proper representation, will look through every nook and cranny of their favorite movies, tv shows, and books to find some hint that's somewhere in that story... there's at least a *moment* that... makes them feel like they belong. That's why people cry out for more media produced for queer people by queer people, because otherwise we basically don't exist.

<summary>This bit gets on my nerves as a former historian.</summary>

Yes there are instances in which historians have been willfully obtuse about the presence of a possibly homosexual relationship. But this flippant, sarcastic "oh lol things were different back then SUUUUUUURE" is just idiocy. Yes, things were different. The past is a foriegn country with extremely different cultural and social expectations and assumptions. If you go into reading history with a purely modern mindset you will constantly misread stuff. Reading primary sources requires a huge amount of contextual understanding to avoid this kind of shoddy assumption.

The more modern reason why it's rare for historians to make confident judgements on the sexuality of historical figures is that there's rarely enough evidence to be remotely confident about it. Turns out people didn't write down "yes I like having sex with men" in a time when A. Even the concept of homosexuality was not culturally common, and B. Admitting to it could end your career and very probably your life.

[...] There are occasional cases where it's pretty cut and dry. But most of the time it can only ever be speculation based on limited evidence, and generally speaking idle speculation is to be avoided in academic work. In the worst case it's speculation based on a limited understanding of cultural context, like with Lincoln. Surprise, people didn't have so many hangups about sharing beds in a time where central heating didn't exist (for most people) and families commonly all lived in one room.

There also seems to be a strange element of history which *compulsively* tries to impose postcolonial values upon pre-christianized societies. I'm not sure if it's just that we're so indoctrinated into our own social structures or if our (small "L") liberal society needs to believe that our social values are actually *progressing*, and so we will force history to be as regressive as possible to make our own time look better in contrast. 

But why is it so hard to believe that a Viking society, who believed that a god that shaped everyone out of mead and clay, who hung from a tree connecting nine distinct worlds and realms together, and who was eaten by a wolf the size of the moon... couldn't see that a young boy in the village who liked dresses and flowers might *actually* be a girl.

I mean, it doesn't help that many of these stories were translated and recopied by Christian monks and scholars in the Dark Ages; in many cases their original texts are lost.

So could it also be that we're reading history with, not only a heteronormative lens, but a post-puritan one?

Food for thought: the term "companion" in history almost *always* was used to describe romantic or sexual relations,<sup cn></sup> not "buds" or "gal pals". That's why the movie *Long-Term Companion* is called that and not "Long-Term Friend With Benefits". 

It's almost as if our ancestors never really expected homophobia or sex-phobia to be a serious issue. Instead we have to dig through implications, through innuendo, through double-entendres that were meant to be dirty jokes, that somehow survived over centuries, but whose double meanings can be dismissed as... just being from a different time.

I'm actually about to break your brains, but history has been gay a *lot* longer than heterosexuality has existed. Before Freud and Kinsey, sexuality was largely regarded as fluid. All that talk about "the homosexuals are going to corrupt your brothers, sons, and husbands" sounds ridiculous to us today because we think of sexuality as largely fixed. The term "homosexual", "heterosexual", "bisexual"... they're all terms that arose out of the latter part of the 19th century, not... Greece and Rome. Before that, academics tried to describe same-sex attraction simply as sexual inversion. Though we were mostly just referred to as "queers" and "perverts". But as the concept of homosexuality *didn't exist*, neither did heterosexuality.

As early as the 1930s and 40s, people actually did literally believe that sexual acts between two men were something that any man was capable of, and this is clear in criminal cases prosecuting men for having sex with men. It was specifically the acts of buggery and fellatio that were observed as illegal. (Also known more generally as "sodomy"). Courts prosecuted men as it was a crime that they chose to do. Or an illicit lifestyle that they chose. Agency, and the choice to commit illicit acts of what was called "perversion", was key in the prosecution of these men.

These are all, I know, abstract questions that come down to different theories regarding film and queerness, and whose answers are much murkier than one would probably like. <mark>The vitriol thrown toward *The Imitation Game* made me consider films with queer characters that were not queer films and, conversely, films with straight characters, or at least a lack of queer ones, and yet still fit within</mark> <mark x>that vague cinematic categorization.</mark> For the latter, it’s easy to look towards the work of Todd Haynes: an out filmmaker to be sure, his depictions of queerness exist primarily in *Far From Heaven*, *Poison*, and *Velvet Goldmine*. Yet, monumental films like *[SAFE]* and *Mildred Pierce* still qualify as piece of queer texts. Part of this is that both texts serve allegorical purposes: both Julianne Moore’s and Kate Winslet’s characters are adrift and othered in the culture they should hypothetically belong in; Moore even becomes *allergic* to it.

This bit feels a lot like Lindsay Ellis's video on RENT, [specifically her line (at 6:37)](https://youtu.be/q0qfFbtIj5w?t=393) "This is also one of the rare representations of a bisexual character, although she, of course, is the Slutty McSlutter-Slutterson who wants to slut it up with every living human, because 'bi.'" Lindsay also talks about the Gen X whining (not those words specifically in this video; she has used those words in other videos), and she talks about the filming of "I'll Follow You".

It just feels odd. We're over two decades out from *Will and Grace*. *Queer as Folk* spent five years on TV showing gay characters being *very* sexual. Ryan Murphy has made a career of queering up TV and streaming. Hollywood hasn't *really* shied away from it; they've made movies like *Brokeback Mountain*. But here's *The Imitation Game*, legs squeezed tightly together, too afraid to give up its modesty, but *desperately* wanting to be invited to the orgy. Acknowledging that, yes, Alan Turing was gay, but *hey! How about that science?!*

*The Imitation Game* shows Alan Turing in a relationship with Kira Nightly, despite the fact that he was chemically castrated for being gay. This is after he developed technology that turned the tide of World War II. If the film intends to depict Alan Turing as important and significant, why isn't it chronicling the way he died? 

The English Government... tried a war hero as a *criminal* because of who he loved. Turing opted for chemical castration instead of prison. This process introduces a flood of hormones that, as intended, would erase sexual libido, rendering him impotent. This process also severely impedes the brain's ability to naturally reduce and regulate hormones in the blood. Turing developed severe depression... and eventually killed himself. His story in history is not only one of genius and perseverance, but also of a tragedy that *could* have been avoided without bigoted laws. The laws and culture that Turing defended were the ones that sentenced him. But *The Imitation Game* ignores this, essentially presenting homophobic English laws as being just as heroic as Turing. It's annoying.

That the great writers of Edwardian England, like Virginia Wolf, *embraced* their queerness. That the man who stopped the Nazi war machine in its *tracks* was inhumanely punished, because he loved men. 

The next generation should know about these men and women. Their stories, their accomplishments, how they change the world. So that they know they too can change the world. To make it that much easier for them. <mark>To start feeling around in the dark for the closet door.</mark>

Because the thing is, <mark>queer stories aren’t just for</mark> the queer people that already exist—queering history queers the audience. More millennials identify as LGBTQ than any generation before them, and that’s because millennials grew up knowing that being LGBTQ was a legitimate option. Queer people who are in the closet today can watch these films and see queer people who have been in the closet for all of history, since even if one specific biopic subject wasn’t really in the closet, there have certainly been enough people in the closet throughout history to make up the difference! To wit, queer people who haven’t realized they are queer yet—a much larger proportion of humans who have ever existed than many people believe—can see these films and get the tip-off that leads them <mark>to start feeling around in the dark for the closet door.</mark>
