Believe it or not, studio heads rarely know what they're doing, which is how you can have money catapulted at projects like Cleopatra or Mommie Dearest. And especially in the case of the latter. All that ends up doing is giving an inflated budget to the kind of overwrought and overacted content that you would get in what is considered be cinema.

And especially if that high budget B-movie pulls in an audience. Creators who love big cinema are going to feel very validated, like Quentin Tarantino growing up on martial arts, movies, and then getting to make one of his own with a Hollywood budget and Kill Bill could also be described as camp for any number of reasons. But when it specifically came to feminine centric burlesque esthetic, the 1980s opened a lot of doors to have producers approve movies with more obvious camp sensibilities.

Nothing about a movie that was exclusively made to ape off of the success of a board game implies that said movie would end up becoming a camp milestone. But here we are. In 1985, Paramount Pictures distributed Clue, the movie, which, yes, is directly inspired by the board game, and they didn't really seem to care what it was. As long as there was a movie based on it, the qualifications for meeting the outlined parameters were incredibly vague, which could have gone one of two ways.

Either you get a movie that follows the path of least resistance and you end up with a product that is phenomenally lackluster or lifeless, or you hand it to a bunch of enthusiastic creatives who really want to use that lack of specifics to play around with what they can do. And really, when you're told you have to make a movie about a murder with a collection of arbitrary, if not otherwise, entirely mundane objects in a fabulous mansion with secret passages, with a number of outrageous murder suspects.

If you're not feeding into the natural absurdity, then you're not doing your job. Clue. The board game is focused around up to six players named after colors. There are nine rooms in the mansion and six murder weapons. The premise is that Mr. Body, the fabulously wealthy estate owner, is murdered at a party attended by all the suspects. Each suspect, weapon and room has a corresponding card.

Each group is shuffled and one from each is selected and put in an envelope to be revealed at the end of the game. Players move select selected token around the board, going to each room looking for clues at any time after viewing any number of clue cards. Not in the envelope. A player can make a guess at which three cards are in the envelope.

To win, a player must guess all three correctly. If the guess is wrong, the player loses by default and is removed from the game. In game law is that they're murdered by the real murderer. Clue. The movie features references to every single facet of the game, including corresponding secret passages, saying each room by name and having each murder weapon included.

The primary difference is the addition of several characters. Wadsworth The Butler, played by Tim Curry. Yvette The maid, the cook, the cop, the motorist and the singing telegram girl. WADSWORTH And if that specifically adds an extra element to the story as they function as the rulebook, they explain to the players what this game is.

Nearly everyone added to the plot is there to get murdered with a different murder weapon. The way it goes is that six guests who seem to have no relation to each other are invited to Mr. Body's mansion for reasons unknown, presumably some costume party. They are told to only use provided monikers. Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White. Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet.

Wadsworth guides them through the rules of the evening's festivities, and after introductions, reveals that he has brought them here because they are all connected to their absent host, Mr. Body, Though none of them know Mr. Body directly, he has been secretly blackmailing all of them, and Wadsworth wants them to join together to testify against Mr. Body and to have him arrested.

Mr. Body shows up prepared for this mutiny and has brought with him a number of murder weapons and proposes that instead they murder Wadsworth and save themselves the public disgrace.

But then people keep dying and nobody out of the core seven can figure out who's doing it. So they all split up to search the manor in pairs for the murderer before concluding that the murderer is, in fact, one of them.

The film is less about plot and more about giving some of these outrageous personalities the chance to interact with each other. You've got war criminals and embezzlers. A phone service, madam.

The film's plot is also a parody of McCarthyism and its witch hunts and a juxtaposition of true American morality being upheld by this reviled group of people. And to top off the Sun, when the film was released, they shot three endings and shipped out versions to theaters at random. There was no way to be sure which ending which theater was getting.

In this instance, though, it's on purpose. But the primary reason why this movie gets remembered is because of this cast of characters, specifically these horrible women who, in spite of being horrible to slay in all cases, literally. Actually, the difference is from the aforementioned examples is that clue does not make any attempt to tone down these characters. They were deliberately comedic and what made them entertaining revolved around distilling the most outrageous elements of them and making that the whole character start with outrageous personalities and then build the world and plot to match that energy.

The shenanigans that are considered normal in this world fit because everyone is living in it. If everyone's absurd, then absurd is the new normal. What also helped is that each caricature is built around a specific expression of gender, and so gender becomes the highlight of each character, which is how you ended up with a cast that more or less focused upon a collection of very heightened women and Tim Curry and a supposedly gay character, which is what gave the gays something to latch on to.

And while Clu has its underground cult of queer fans who know this is a much better eighties comedy than the Reagan era Jerkoff Fest, that was Ghostbusters. The movie did not make its money back at the box office. Part of the reason may have been the studio overspending on a movie based on a board game. That mystery isn't so hard to figure out.

For the longest time, campy movies were stuck to small budgets. And while it may have been because of Mommie Dearest that they began to get pulled into the mainstream, they struggled to perform well among mainstream audiences in theaters, as mentioned with Clue.

Believe it or not, actors are people too, which means a lot of them don't mind being in frivolously fond movies. They get to chew the scenery like Faye.

I was actually tempted to talk about Rocky Horror as a case study in this one, but there's enough there that's going to have to have its own video. Anyway, death becomes her star's Meryl Streep after she had already won two Academy Awards and Goldie Hawn, who had already won one. Both had been receiving nominations since the seventies.

The film was also meant to feature Carrie Fisher, a good friend of Meryl Streep. Streep starred in Postcards from the Edge two years prior, a movie based on Fisher's autobiographical book of the same name.

I find a lot of those intentionally bad movies tend to get a little stale halfway through because they keep leaning on the same sensibility when it comes to good, bad movies.

Now, camp as a style of comedy was still a bit niche, and people who weren't in the know might not have bought tickets. What was mistaken about Mommie Dearest is that it was not necessarily the film that drew the fandom, but the diva herself.

Camp as an esthetic can be seen in good cinema. The thing is, you need to build an entire world from the ground up.

The living art projects of David Bowie, the boundless genre defying queer energy of Freddie Mercury, and even the glistening muscles of 300 Spartans and enemy Superman. It's all camp. It's all more than a little queer. And it's all us. We queers not so secretly define the culture we live in, no matter what the straights think. So this June of 2022 Pride Month in the United States go to parties, parades, events, seminars, protests, as you normally would.

But for those of you who don't recognize entries in this list, I hope you make some time for movie marathons. By all means, watch the movies on this list.

No matter how many Eve Harringtons try to steal our luster, no matter how many small towns try to burn us at the stake. No matter how many fiends try to murder us with a candle stick in the library, we're not going anywhere. Hell, we can take over the whole damn world. Because if camp has taught us anything, it's how to make the absurd into reality.
