Chapter 1: Berlin - Homosexual Capital of Europe

<mark>In the early years of the twentieth century, life was extremely difficult for gay men and women.</mark> <mark>In cities that now celebrate gay pride, homosexuals<sup>(1)</sup> were actively persecuted. Laws prohibited sex between men.</mark> As a result, most homosexuals were forced to lead secret lives and had to establish their own underground networks.

Chapter 1: Before the Storm 

The Nazi war against Germany's homosexuals, to be properly understood, must be seen against the backdrop of the terrible tensions and social traumas that ultimately were to cause the collapse of the Weimar Republic. <mark>For the severe economic depression, widespread unemployment, galloping inflation, and bitter civil strife that were to engulf Germany in the wake of World War I</mark> also consigned the country's small but vigorous homosexual-rights movement to oblivion. That movement, which began around the turn of the century, would reach its peak in the early 1920s, under the remarkable leadership of Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. It would enjoy its greatest influence at precisely the moment that the larger society whose prejudices it sought to change began to spin out of control. To understand the fate of Germany’s homosexuals it is necessary to grasp not only the specific events and warring ideologies that destroyed the Weimar Republic and created the conditions that permitted the rise of the Nazis, but also the general atmosphere of Germany between 1919 and 1933.<sup>1</sup>

An incomprehensible economic sickness infected everyone, diminishing all salaries and gobbling up savings. Everywhere, pawnshops were packed, and relief rolls lengthened. The labour unions, too, in which many had put their trust, failed. Since the unions’ funds were gone, they could no longer resist the demands of employers: the ten-hour day returned to many industries. Unions began to lose members. Death and suicide rates rose; many children suffered from malnutrition. Those who had left the unions - and there were hundreds upon hundreds of thousands - found themselves politically adrift. Neither the left-wing Social Democratic Party (to which most labour unions belonged) nor the liberal or right-wing parties offered any prescriptions to cure this epidemic.

Many began to join the extremist parties of both the left and the right; many joined first the left, then the right. The promise of dramatic change suddenly made sense. Men were hungry too long, and now they were angry and desperate.

<mark>Into this social cauldron was added the fifth and most poisonous ingredient: the Nazi Party. As the number of unemployed rose, the Nazi membership rolls grew.</mark> To be sure, just before Franz von Papen maneuvered Hitler into the chancellorship in 1933, the Nazis had lost quite a few members. Still, the rise in unemployment and the growing strength of the Nazis were indissolubly linked. <mark>The Nazi Party not only provided food, weapons, and a splendid uniform, it proclaimed a new purpose, a new faith, and a new prophet. Inflation and unemployment catapulted into power a man who promised rebirth to all "Aryan" Germans, regardless of status.</mark> Hitler vowed to avenge the injustices of the Treaty of Versailles, and to punish the culprits who had been responsible for Germany’s defeat. As was so often the case, Hitler’s rhetoric was littered with sexual metaphors. Jews and other minorities, for example, were guilty of the “syphilitization of our people.” In 1935, Nazi lawyer Hans Frank would warn that the “epidemic of homosexuality” was threatening the new Reich.<sup>4</sup> America, too, was an enemy, a “niggerized Jewish country”<sup>5</sup> where women painted their faces - a practice that enraged Nazi moralists. Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, would later boast that no Aryan woman he knew ever used lipstick. It was Himmler who would mastermind the attacks on homosexuals, whom he endowed with the same subhuman, dangerous qualities as were ascribed to Jews, Communists and Gypsies.<sup>6</sup>

It seems to be more of Nick's "raw observation", because the bit before it is about how the sort of people who could better get away with being openly queer were artists and performers and such. But there's no reason to believe (that I can find) that a) they even were more financially stable during the inflation crisis, or b) even if they were, that that specifically was causally linked to any kind of police crackdown

The closest thing I could find in the book was a general statement that unemployed people [of the majority group] are generally less tolerant of minorities. Which yeah, of course, that's still true today. It does not therefore follow that minorities are more likely to be self-employed and that's why the unemployed are prejudiced against them! I shouldn't have to explain to two queer people that bigots generally don't even think that hard about their prejudices, they don't have to make "logical" sense.

For the first time the Third Reich showed its true face. <mark>In Munich, Hitler ordered the SA regulars to the “Brown House,” screaming that they were all “homosexual pigs,” though he well knew that only a few in Roehm’s immediate entourage were homosexual.</mark> In Berlin, Goring greeted the stunned SA lieutenants with abuse, also calling them “homosexual pigs.”<sup>2</sup>

<mark>So far, Ernst Roehm had been spared.</mark> We will never know whether Hitler was beset by any last minute regrets about his oldest comrade. <mark>In any case, on July 1, an SS officer entered Roehm’s prison cell, handed him a revolver, and said,</mark> <mark>“I’ll be back in fifteen minutes.</mark> <mark>You have a choice.”</mark> Roehm is supposed to have answered, <mark>“Let Adolf do it himself. I’m not going to do his job.”<sup>3</sup></mark> <mark>Later that same day, Roehm was finally executed by two SS hitmen,</mark> led by Theodor Eicke, later picked by Himmler to organise the proliferating concentration camps. The corpses of the Stadelheim victims were taken away in a butcher’s tin-lined truck.

<h2>Aftermath</h2>

<mark>As the purge claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans, it could hardly be kept secret. At first, its architects seemed split on how to handle the event. Göring instructed police stations to burn "all documents concerning the action of the past two days."<sup>[52]</sup> Meanwhile, Goebbels tried to prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead, but at the same time used a July 2 radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented Röhm and Schleicher from overthrowing the government and throwing the country into turmoil.<sup>[46]</sup> Then, on July 13, 1934, Hitler justified the purge in a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag:</mark>

"If anyone reproaches me and asks why I did not resort to the regular courts of justice, then all I can say is this. <mark>In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme judge of the German people.</mark> I gave the order to shoot the ringleaders in this treason, and I further gave the order to cauterise down to the raw flesh the ulcers of this poisoning of the wells in our domestic life. Let the nation know that its existence—which depends on its internal order and security—cannot be threatened with impunity by anyone! And let it be known for all time to come that if anyone raises his hand to strike the State, then certain death is his lot."<sup>[53][54]</sup>

<mark>WITH ROEHM DEAD AND THE SA Vanquished, Himmler and the SS quickly emerged alongside Hitler as the true victors. Within a short time, Himmler would preside over an empire of death whose factories of mass extermination would work around the clock, turning contragenics into ash. He was now the second most powerful man in the Third Reich. And like his master, he now had the opportunity to realize his deepest obsessions. His every whim, however perverse or murderous, was regarded by his SS henchmen as law. The mammoth effort to effect Hitler’s “Final Solution” for Europe’s Jews would increasingly absorb his time and energy.</mark> In this, unfortunately, he was largely successful. <mark>Himmler had a special horror of homosexuals, whom he was determined to exterminate</mark> as well. <mark>In this he enjoyed only a partial success. His raging homophobia, which was responsible for a vicious campaign against Germany’s homosexuals, struck fear in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of gays, and resulted in the deaths of thousands of others.</mark> In order to understand why he put such an effort into this campaign, we have to try to unravel the strands of his twisted personality.

Himmler was obsessed, all right, but it was another type of compulsion - less visible than Hitler’s, more like that of a reclusive miser constantly counting his hoard of gold. This bureaucratic side, however, was not how most of the world saw him. <mark>The world perceived Himmler as the butcher who ordered all Russian prisoners of war to be killed, and as the man who organized the destruction of European Jewry.

Next to Reinhard Heydrich, chief security officer who was assassinated in 1942, Himmler's name was the most feared throughout Germany and the occupied territories. His image was that of a monster, devoid of any shred of humanity. He did little to dispel that impression. In October of 1943, for example, he told SS leader assembled in Poznan, Poland:</mark>

Shortly thereafter - and nearly a year before the Roehm purge - the Law for the Protection of Hereditary Health was enacted, a barely noticed omen of mass killings to come. Here terms such as “racially inferior offspring,” “deviant psychopath,” “criminally insane person,” and “unneeded consumers” were first introduced. Homosexuals should especially have been on their guard; as early as the fall of 1933, some were sent to Dachau and to Fuhlsbüttel, near Hamburg.<sup>2</sup> <mark>Yet most gays hoped they could weather the storm. Many rushed to join the Nazi Party in the belief that they could vanish among the uniformed crowds; others hoped for the best, and although bars, cafés, and dancing places catering to homosexuals were eliminated, they tried to continue their lives as unobtrusively as possible. Gradually, many realized that their existence was threatened, and they lived in constant fear of discovery. Others joined the armed forces, over which the Gestapo was never to gain complete jurisdiction. But not until Roehm and his confederates were executed did most homosexuals believe that a country like Germany could fall back into barbarism. Now, however, there could be no mistaking the murderous intentions of the Nazis. There could be no doubt any longer that the Nazis were as violently opposed to sexual deviants as they were to such racial deviants as Jews and Gypsies.</mark>

Just as we have readopted the ancient Germanic approach to the question of marriage between alien races, so, too, in our judgement of homosexuality - a symptom of racial degeneracy destructive to our race - we have returned to the guiding Nordic principle that degenerates should be exterminated.

<mark>Barely two weeks later, on October 26, the Federal Security Department for Combating Abortion and Homosexuality was established in the Berlin Gestapo headquarters. It was headed by SS Captain Joseph Meisinger, an ex-policeman from Bavaria who previously had been occupied with the distribution of confiscated Jewish properties.</mark> His zeal pleased Himmler at first, but later the SS chief had to acknowledge that Meisinger’s intellectual equipment was insufficient. When, in 1938, Meisinger mismanaged the von Fritsch affair, he was transferred to Poland. There, as Gestapo supervisor, he started a reign of such brutality that even his fascist co-workers denounced him. He disappeared into Japan but was surrendered by U.S. authorities to Poland, where a Polish court had him executed in March 1947 in Warsaw.<sup>7</sup>

The all-encompassing control of the Nazi police directorates can only be appreciated by grasping the essence of the new jurisprudence. <mark>By 1936 the traditional, more conservative police agencies were “federalized,” which meant that Himmler ruled virtually unchallenged.</mark> From 1935 and 1936 on, higher legal officers were appointed by Wilhelm Frick, the Minister of Interior. <mark>Prosecutors were granted more leeway, while defense lawyers and judges lost power. The rules of factual evidence were abolished.

Two centuries before, King Frederick II of Prussia had abolished torture as a legal instrument for extracting confessions or the names of accomplices. Now, in every large city, people were legally tortured and executed in the cellars of Gestapo buildings. No one arrested on charges of real or trumped-up homosexual activity could count on a fair trial. If, before 1933, homosexuals had been second-class citizens, now they were slowly expatriated like the Fypsies, denaturalized like the Jews. They could be doubly scapegoated, as “incurably sick” and therefore candidates for mercy death, or as “congenitally criminal deviants,” to be reeducated in camps. <mark>In December 1934 the Ministry of Justice issued new guidelines stating that homosexual offenses did not have actually to be committed to be punishable; intent was what mattered.</mark> This emphasis on intent originally had been brought to bear in various cases of Jewish men accused of having had sexual relations with non-Jewish women. Since both groups were regarded as contagious subhumans, similar strategies could be employed against them. There were, however, significant differences in their treatment, as we shall see.

Lesbians, unlike some homosexual men, had not developed theories exalting a special, same-sex society; they had produced no Hans Blüher. Moreover, women could be tender with other women without arousing undue suspicion, and it would be difficult to discover, much less prosecute, lesbian acts that were carried out in private. Klare therefore regretfully accepted the fact that, for the moment, sexual contacts between women would have to go unpunished, but he hoped this would prove only temporary.<sup>11</sup>

<mark>Nazi jurists ignored Klare’s pleas, and Himmler seems never to have made any statements about lesbians. Nevertheless, some – albeit very few - German lesbians were caught in the machinery of the secret police. Little was known of their fate</mark> until quite recently. In 1975, Ina Kukuc published an account of how some SS officers had arrested and sentenced lesbians.<sup>12</sup> The one victim on whom she reports most extensively was brought to court on a charge of treason - which was almost certainly false. Helene G. from Schleswig-Holstein had been working for the counterintelligence division of the Luftwaffe and sharing her residence with another woman, a lesbian. Toward the end of 1944, a young lieutenant wanted to bed Helene’s girlfriend and, when rebuffed, took his revenge. The two women were denounced and arrested. Helene, indicted for military subversion, was expelled from the air force and sent to Camp Butzow. This violated regulations because Butzow was specially designated as a penal camp for recalcitrant prisoners of war. It did not matter. She and five lesbians were thrown into an empty cell block, under the command of male constables. <mark fc>“These are the scum of the earth,” the guards are reported to have told the French and Russian POWs. “We wouldn’t fuck them with a sofa leg.”</mark> <mark>The prisoners were promised a rare reward: for each woman they penetrated, they would be given a bottle of schnapps.</mark> This grotesque sport was, of course, a violation of Himmler’s orders concerning the purity of the German race. POWs were to be severely punished for having had, or having tried to have, intercourse with German women. But then, the entire case, like so many others, had no legal foundation and serves only to emphasise the extent to which the SS felt itself to be free of all moral and ethical restraint. In the end, the only law that was respected was the law of the jungle.

In regards to the specific incident described, I could not find how it ended. In a more general sense, this is false; women were raped by their fellow prisoners, as well as guards, in the prisons and camps. The second claim seems to be that prisoners sexually assaulted German guards upon liberation, which I also found no evidence for; beating and killing guards, yes, but not that.

But it is not known if the larger organisation, the Friendship League, headed by Radzuweit, managed to get rid of its archives early enough.</mark> Some 28,000 members paid regular yearly fees to the League.<sup>25</sup> Their names may well have landed on the desk of Captain Meisinger. Another means of identifying suspected homosexuals lay in the confiscated subscription lists of about thirty magazines of more or less homosexual orientation then available in larger cities.<sup>26</sup> Although most of these were probably purchased on newsstands, some may have been obtained by subscription. By 1938 and 1939, gay bars, clubs, and organizations had disappeared. Yet informers on all contragenics were constantly being trained. The authorities encouraged every citizen to report on all who exhibited the slightest evidence of deviance. <mark>Moreover, how was it possible for a suspect to prove that he had *not* thrown an “offensive glance” at another man? In at least one instance, a man was arrested not because he had been watching a young couple make love in a park, but because he had been seen observing the actions of the man more than those of the woman.<sup>27</sup></mark> Julius Streicher, editor of Der Stürmer, had urged his readers to write to him about Jewish men suspected of having, or trying to establish, relations with non-Jewish women. Denunciatory letters poured in.<sup>28</sup> The same pattern held true for other contragenics. It was easy for anyone who wanted to get rid of a competitor to brand the rival as a homosexual. With one short anonymous note to the local Gestapo branch, the enemy of the state could be taken into protective custody or, at least, thoroughly interrogated. Later, after the war had started in earnest, the authorities divided every city into administrative blocks. Each block was supervised by a block warden, whose mission was to spy on everybody.

It was supplemented by the idea that "'the Order is destiny.' it meant everything to its brother-members, including the sexual sphere. Homosexuality was part of the program. Even more, in various political and philosophical disguises it was accepted as a basic ideological creed. Thus, the unnatural became the guiding principle."

<mark>According to statistics compiled by the Nazis and discovered after the war’s end,</mark> there were roughly 2.4 million teenage boys who were arrested under various charges, yet only 25,000 of those cases were crimes against Paragraph 175, and of that only 3,976 were convicted,</mark> essentially <mark stat:id="m-context">47 out of every 10,000</mark>.<sup cn>1</sup>

<mark>According to statistics compiled by the Nazis and discovered after the war’s end, only 3,976 male teenagers between fourteen and eighteen years old, of the more than 25,000 juveniles arrested for crimes against Paragraph 175, were convicted between 1933 and 1940. Since the total of juveniles during this period amounted to about 2.4 million,</mark> this number is relatively small. The legal department of the Hitler Youth had researched the cases of 100,000 juveniles convicted of all sorts of illegal deeds only to discover that on the average, just <mark>forty-seven out of ten thousand</mark> crimes were of a homosexual nature. <mark>This was embarrassing; Schirach, like Himmler, was convinced that homosexuals formed a greater portion of the criminal population.

These figures must be treated with caution. They indicate only the number of people arrested and sentenced for homosexuality; they tell nothing of the truth of that charge.

Okay, the thing about Somerton is that sometimes he will cite his sources and you can just read along and see where he's adding things. He got most of this video from Richard Plant's *The Pink Triangle* and the passage he's quoting from actually says that 15% of the *teenage boys* kicked out of the Hitler Youth were kicked out for being being gay, not the adult leadership.

Also, again, gays in the military were not "excused" for "having gay sexual encounters." The book says the exact opposite. Some of the claims that James makes here and in other places, regarding homosexuality within the Nazi party, are also found in *The Pink Swastika*, a pseudohistorical book written by an anti-gay rightwinger that promotes the gay Nazi myth. The book's claims have been debunked by many historians and other writers. See, for example, [*The Annotated Pink Swastika*](http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/anti/annotated.pink.swastika)

<mark>In 1942, Hitler declared that the armed forces were too lenient in their treatment of sexual deviants.</mark> There was probably more behind this than Hitler’s pleasure in the badgering the military. Himmler, who a year earlier had prescribed the death penalty for any SS member guilty of homosexual actions, had probably pressured Hitler to the armed forces to conform. After all, an SS man caught with a sailor could be executed, while the sailor might get away with one or two years in jail. A psychiatrist, Otto Wuth, was appointed to alert military jurists to the dangers of all types of homosexuality. Wuth, a firm believer in Himmler’s scriptures, disapproved of the distinction between full-time libidinal felons and part-time victims. He labelled every male indulging in any type of same-sex activities a “compulsive psychopath,” and sought to prove that most homosexuals had previous criminal records of one sort or another. Should men convicted of homosexual felonies be dismissed from the armed forces? Wuth thought not. He proposed to put them instead into penal combat battalions where they had to face direct enemy fire. Wuth argued that if genuine psychopaths were discharged from the fighting forces, heterosexual malingerers might pretend to be libidinal felons and use this ruse to get out of service. For repeat offenders, Wuth recommended demotion in rank for minor violations, and strict prison sentences for major crimes; all criminals were to wear a visible badge denoting their status.

This is somewhat true, according to the next few pages of *The Pink Triangle*. [However, soldiers were still imprisoned or executed on accusations of homosexuality, even later in the war.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A30A542D219DAFA5A547022C5A93D44C/S0960777323000644a.pdf/ideology_and_the_application_of_law_in_ss_courts_a_case_study_of_legal_practice_in_the_third_reich.pdf) Also see Plant 146: "Still, the military was not overly lenient toward same-sex offenders. It meted out justice according to the old laws established by the Prussian army before 1870." It then details two cases of sailors imprisoned for kissing or propositioning other sailors. The armed forces just weren't as strict as Himmler would have preferred, owing to the fact that they were never completely under the control of the Gestapo. And "nice Aryan boys having sex with each other" is... an odd way of putting it.

This is more or less true, according to Plant 149: "Despite the paucity of reliable statitics, it seem reasonable to conclude that a considerable number - perhaps even a majority - of the tougher and more circumspect, resourceful, and just plain lucky homosexuals survived the Third Reich undetected." However, "Still, even for those who managed to survive, their day and nights were filled with fear. It was impossible to trust anyone, especially strangers. Moreover, from 1935 on, every gay German man knew that if he was caught he risked being shipped to a concentration camp."

Basically, Eicke worked out two sets of rules, one for camp personnel, one for inmates. Of the code for guards, only certain sections were put on paper; much of it was passed on through indoctrination sessions. Foremost, he insisted on unconditional obedience.

I cannot find any evidence of experiments that match James' description. Gay men were certainly experimented on in the camps with castration and hormones, and their calcium levels were checked before and after castration in 1944 (Plant 177), but I could not find anything regarding hormones making someone impervious to pain, or "target practice" being involved, or men with low calcium levels being executed.

Also, that's not how shock works. Circulatory shock is caused by a variety of injuries and health conditions, not pain. A person cannot die just because they are in too much pain, and blocking pain will not prevent a person from dying.

Buchenwald did the castration-hormone experiments specifically on gay men, but it carried out other experiments on the general population, including the aforementioned yellow fever experiment, so it's not quite accurate to say that they used gay men *exclusively*. For the other camps, it is possible that gay men were among the test subjects as well, but Somerton seems to imply that they were specifically targeted when they were not, outside of Buchenwald.

Since they were technically in the concentration camps because of a supposed "crime" they had committed, they were sometimes put into German prisons after they got out of the camps. Others were sent to Soviet prison camps in the north. Paragraph 175 had been on the books since 1871, and so the Supreme Court of Germany ruled in 1957 that Paragraph 175 still stood since it was not a law made by the Nazis. As noted, Paragraph 175 was strengthened by the Nazis and made into a more strict version of the law.

Since they were technically in the concentration camps because of a "crime" that they committed, they were sometimes put into Soviet prisons after they got out of the camps. Paragraph 175 had been on the books since 1871, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 1957 that Paragraph 175 still stood since it was not a law made by the Nazis. As noted, however, Paragraph 175 was strengthened by the Nazis and made into a more strict version of the law. So homosexuals were more persecuted during the Nazi regime than ever before, and in a much more brutal way than before or after the Holocaust, however the court did not recognize this. Paragraph 175 was kept on the books in Germany until 1969,</mark> meaning homosexuality was still thought of as a crime until that year. <mark>One man recalls that he was repeatedly arrested under Paragraph 175 throughout the 1950s and '60s.<sup>87</sup> While other prisoners were trying to make sense of what happened and rebuild their lives and families, homosexual prisoners faced even more discrimination, hardships, and imprisonment.</mark>

Some other Nazi era laws remained on the books, [even up until as recently as 2021](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210122-germany-moves-to-eradicate-lingering-nazi-laws). The linked article was published after the video's release, but there was no proof that Paragraph 175 was the only remaining Nazi law, even if it was likely the most significant.

*Stigmatization of Survivors/Reparations*

Homosexual survivors of the Holocaust often faced extreme discrimination once they were liberated from the camps, even if they were not put into Soviet prisons. Survivors had to go back to their towns, and find family and friends, many of now knew the reason that the survivor was taken to the camps in the fust place. <mark>Survivors often had to lie about why they were in the camps and keep quiet about their experiences. Prisoners who were in specifically homosexual barracks, or had experiments done on them, often kept quiet because they didn't feel that they could share their experiences for fear of ridicule or scorn. One man was in the concentration camps for over eight years, and when he got out, he went right back to work in his family store. He said he never told his mother anything that happened in the camps, he just kept everything quiet and went to work.</mark> He didn't think that she would be able to hear everything that went on, and didn't want her to have to deal with his "crime". He talked about "patiently carrying one's burden" and feeling shame about his imprisonment because he was imprisoned as a homosexual.<sup>88</sup> It was because of this shame that he never spoke to his mother about what had happened to him for over eight years. So much of his life and torture had to be repressed and kept a secret from everyone because he felt shame and was unsure how people would react. <mark>This was a common theme between many of the homosexual survivors of the Holocaust. They were shamed into silence.</mark> Their experience went unheard for many years because no one wanted to hear it, and they felt ashamed to tell it. Prisoners often felt isolated by their neighbors who knew that they were a homosexual and stayed away from them.<sup>89</sup> One prisoner recalls that after a week or so, no one wanted to hear about his experience anymore. They were horrified by it and could not comprehend what had happened, so they didn't want to talk about it anymore. <mark>The Nazis aimed to eradicate the homosexuals or "re-educate" them, and as Professor Lautmann of the University of Breman put it, the re-education towards heterosexuality was somewhat achieved by the collective silence of the homosexual victims.<sup>90</sup></mark>

*Memorialization*

<mark>In the 1990s, after the reunification of Germany, more LGBT rights groups and homosexual survivors of the holocaust began demanding an official memorial for the homosexual victims of the Holocaust. There were already many memorials for the other groups persecuted by the Nazis however, the homosexuals were routinely left out. Other survivors were not comfortable including the homosexuals in their memorials, and so they were left off of group memorials, continuing decades of discrimination and hurt.</mark> Historians warn that when writing about the Holocaust, people must be careful not to engage in, "a crass game of competitive victimhood."<sup>94</sup> Everyone suffered horrible tortures in the concentration camp and it would not be fair to say who suffered worse or deserves more compensations or memorials. Yet, the homosexual victims did not start to be recognized until the 1990s, after they started to demand they be heard.

Some memorials started off as "guerilla memorials" where gay rights groups would go and place wreaths at the concentration camps recognizing the gay victims. One gay rights group actually got permission to put a memorial with a pink triangle and the inscription "Beaten to Death-Silenced to Death" at Mauthausen concentration camp. This memorial not only speaks to the treatment of the gay victims within the camps, but also the continued silence that happened afterwards. Other memorials to the the victims began to be approved by the German state over time. Multiple camps started to put up memorial plaques at the sites of the homosexual barracks, most notably the one in Buchenwald. Other countries like the Netherlands, had memorials put up much earlier than in Germany. In 2003, one of Germany's largest and most well-known memorials to homosexual victims was approved, and was finished in 2008.

Upon encountering the memorial, visitors are faced with watching a same-sex encounter and have to deal with their own feelings and potential prejudices about the video displayed.

In many ways, the spectres of the Third Reich still haunt us. The spectres begin to come to life whenever fanatics of any sect try to take over a nation and call for a war against its most vulnerable and vilified minorities. Since the end of World War II and the discovery of the Nazi death machine, every modern nation across the globe has spoken the same mantras:

We have to do what we can to get gay men and women and trans people out of countries that would see them murdered by the state, get them away from vicious leaders who would rather see them riddled with bullets than holding hands. We must learn the lessons that were taught in Europe, and then we must mean it. 

We must act... when we say... "Never again."
