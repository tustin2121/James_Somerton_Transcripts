A special note: Trans women were also persecuted but Germany categorized them as gay men so there's no official records to refer to.

After the war, criminals were still looked down on for their misdeeds. <mark>The homosexual men had it particularly rough after the war. They were often shamed into silence, put in Soviet prisons, and left off of memorials.</mark> <mark>This silencing of their histories has left minimal sources about the subject.

<mark>In the early years of the twentieth century, life was extremely difficult for gay men and women.</mark> <mark>In cities that now celebrate gay pride, homosexuals<sup>(1)</sup> were actively persecuted. Laws prohibited sex between men.</mark> As a result, most homosexuals were forced to lead secret lives and had to establish their own underground networks.

Chapter 1: Before the Storm 

The Nazi war against Germany's homosexuals, to be properly understood, must be seen against the backdrop of the terrible tensions and social traumas that ultimately were to cause the collapse of the Weimar Republic. <mark>For the severe economic depression, widespread unemployment, galloping inflation, and bitter civil strife that were to engulf Germany in the wake of World War I</mark> also consigned the country's small but vigorous homosexual-rights movement to oblivion. That movement, which began around the turn of the century, would reach its peak in the early 1920s, under the remarkable leadership of Dr Magnus Hirschfeld. It would enjoy its greatest influence at precisely the moment that the larger society whose prejudices it sought to change began to spin out of control. To understand the fate of Germany’s homosexuals it is necessary to grasp not only the specific events and warring ideologies that destroyed the Weimar Republic and created the conditions that permitted the rise of the Nazis, but also the general atmosphere of Germany between 1919 and 1933.<sup>1</sup>

An incomprehensible economic sickness infected everyone, diminishing all salaries and gobbling up savings. Everywhere, pawnshops were packed, and relief rolls lengthened. The labour unions, too, in which many had put their trust, failed. Since the unions’ funds were gone, they could no longer resist the demands of employers: the ten-hour day returned to many industries. Unions began to lose members. Death and suicide rates rose; many children suffered from malnutrition. Those who had left the unions - and there were hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of them - found themselves politically adrift. Neither the left-wing Social Democratic Party (to which most labour unions belonged) nor the liberal or right wing parties offered any prescriptions to cure this epidemic.

Inflation and unemployment catapulted into power a man who promised rebirth to all "Aryan" Germans, regardless of status.</mark> Hitler vowed to avenge the injustices of the Treaty of Versailles, and to punish the culprits who had been responsible for Germany’s defeat. As was so often the case, Hitler’s rhetoric was littered with sexual metaphors. Jews and other minorities, for example, were guilty of the “syphilitization of our people.” In 1935, Nazi lawyer Hans Frank would warn that the “epidemic of homosexuality” was threatening the new Reich.<sup>4</sup> America, too, was an enemy, a “niggerized Jewish country”<sup>5</sup> where women painted their faces- a practice that enraged Nazi moralists. Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, would later boast that no Aryan woman he knew ever used lipstick. It was Himmler who would mastermind the attacks on homosexuals, whom he endowed with the same subhuman, dangerous qualities as were ascribed to Jews, Communists and Gypsies.<sup>6</sup>

It seems to be more of Nick's "raw observation", because the bit before it is about how the sort of people who could better get away with being openly queer were artists and performers and such. But there's no reason to believe (that I can find) that a) they even were more financially stable during the inflation crisis, or b) even if they were, that that specifically was causally linked to any kind of police crackdown

The closest thing I could find in the book was a general statement that unemployed people [of the majority group] are generally less tolerant of minorities. Which yeah, of course, that's still true today. It does not therefore follow that minorities are more likely to be self-employed and that's why the unemployed are prejudiced against them! I shouldn't have to explain to two queer people that bigots generally don't even think that hard about their prejudices, they don't have to make "logical" sense.

<mark>As the purge claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans, it could hardly be kept secret. At first, its architects seemed split on how to handle the event. Göring instructed police stations to burn "all documents concerning the action of the past two days."<sup>[52]</sup> Meanwhile, Goebbels tried to prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead, but at the same time used a July 2 radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented Röhm and Schleicher from overthrowing the government and throwing the country into turmoil.<sup>[46]</sup> Then, on July 13, 1934, Hitler justified the purge in a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag:</mark>

"If anyone reproaches me and asks why I did not resort to the regular courts of justice, then all I can say is this. <mark>In this hour I was responsible for the fate of the German people, and thereby I became the supreme judge of the German people.</mark> I gave the order to shoot the ringleaders in this treason, and I further gave the order to cauterise down to the raw flesh the ulcers of this poisoning of the wells in our domestic life. Let the nation know that its existence—which depends on its internal order and security—cannot be threatened with impunity by anyone! And let it be known for all time to come that if anyone raises his hand to strike the State, then certain death is his lot."<sup>[53][54]</sup>

<mark>WITH ROEHM DEAD AND THE SA Vanquished, Himmler and the SS quickly emerged alongside Hitler as the true victors. Within a short time, Himmler would preside over an empire of death whose factories of mass extermination would work around the clock, turning contragenics into ash.

His every whim, however perverse or murderous, was regarded by his SS henchmen as law. The mammoth effort to effect Hitler’s “Final Solution” for Europe’s Jews would increasingly absorb his time and energy.</mark> In this, unfortunately, he was largely successful. <mark>Himmler had a special horror of homosexuals, whom he was determined to exterminate</mark> as well. <mark>In this he enjoyed only a partial success. His raging homophobia, which was responsible for a vicious campaign against Germany’s homosexuals, struck fear in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of gays, and resulted in the deaths of thousands of others.</mark> In order to understand why he put such an effort into this campaign, we have to try to unravel the strands of his twisted personality.

Next to Reinhard Heydrich, chief security officer who was assassinated in 1942, Himmler's name was the most feared throughout Germany and the occupied territories. His image was that of a monster, devoid of any shred of humanity. He did little to dispel that impression. In October of 1943, for example, he told SS leader assembled in Poznan, Poland:</mark>

<mark>On June 28, 1935, Paragraph 175 was revised to extend the concept of “criminally indecent activities between men.” It permitted the authorities to arrest any male on the most ludicrous and transparent charges. From the beginning, courts and judges took it upon themselves to decide what, in their minds, constituted criminal indecency. This meant that previous interpretations of Paragraph 175 as outlawing only actions resembling coitus were now seen as too narrow. Mutual masturbation was declared a felony; a kiss or a touch could be interpreted as criminally indecent. The specialists in the Ministry of Justice were not satisfied until anything that could remotely be considered as sex between men was labelled a transgression.</mark>

But by the fall of 1936, the campaign was renewed.</mark> On October 10, Himmler delivered one of his rare public speeches. In it he sounded many of his familiar ideological formulas. Germany was “surrounded by enemies ready to destroy this heart of Europe…” He was proud to report that the state had started combatting homosexuality in 1934. “As National Socialists we are not afraid to fight against this plague within our own ranks. Just as we have readopted the ancient Germanic approach to the question of marriage between alien races, so, too, in our judgement of homosexuality- a symptom of racial degeneracy destructive to our race- we have returned to the guiding Nordic principle that degenerates should be exterminated.

<mark>Barely two weeks later, on October 26, the Federal Security Department for Combating Abortion and Homosexuality was established in the Berlin Gestapo headquarters. It was headed by SS Captain Joseph Meisinger, an ex-policeman from Bavaria who previously had been occupied with the distribution of confiscated Jewish properties.</mark> His zeal pleased Himmler at first, but later the SS chief had to acknowledge that Meisinger’s intellectual equipment was insufficient. When, in 1938, Meisinger mismanaged the von Fritsch affair, he was transferred to Poland. There, as Gestapo supervisor, he started a reign of such brutality that even his fascist co-workers denounced him. He disappeared into Japan but was surrendered by U.S. authorities to Poland, where a Polish court had him executed in March 1947 in Warsaw.

The all-encompassing control of the Nazi police directorates can only be appreciated by grasping the essence of the new jurisprudence. <mark>By 1936 the traditional, more conservative police agencies were “federalised,” which meant that Himmler ruled virtually unchallenged.</mark> From 1935 and 1936 on, higher legal officers were appointed by Wilhelm Frick, the Minister of Interior. <mark>Prosecutors were granted more leeway, while defence lawyers and judges lost power.

Two centuries before, King Frederick II of Prussia had abolished torture as a legal instrument for extracting confessions or the names of accomplices. Now, in every large city, people were legally tortured and executed in the cellars of Gestapo buildings. No one arrested on charges of real or trumped-up homosexual activity could count on a fair trial. If, before 1933, homosexuals had been second-class citizens, now they were slowly expatriated like the gypsies, denaturalised like the Jews. They could be doubly scapegoated, as “incurably sick” and therefore candidates for mercy death, or as “congenitally criminal deviants,” to be re-educated in camps. <mark>In December 1934 the Ministry of Justice issued new guidelines stating that homosexual offenses did not have actually to be committed to be punishable; intent was what mattered.</mark> This emphasis on intent originally had been brought to bear in various cases of Jewish men accused of having had sexual relations with non-Jewish women. Since both groups were regarded as contagious subhumans, similar strategies could be employed against them. There were, however, significant differences in their treatment, as we shall see.

Lesbians, unlike some homosexual men, had not developed theories exalting a special, same-sex society; they had produced no Hans Bluher. Moreover, women could be tender with other women without arousing undue suspicion, and it would be difficult to discover, much less prosecute, lesbian acts that were carried out in private.

<mark>Nazi jurists ignored Klare’s pleas, and Himmler seems never to have made any statements about lesbians. Nevertheless, some – albeit very few - German lesbians were caught in the machinery of the secret police. Little was known of their fate</mark> until quite recently. In 1975, Ina Kukuc published an account of how some SS officers had arrested and sentenced lesbians. The one victim on whom she reports most extensively was brought to court on a charge of treason- which was almost certainly false. Helene G. from Schleswig-Holstein had been working for the counterintelligence division of the Luftwaffe and sharing her residence with another woman, a lesbian. Toward the end of 1944, a young lieutenant wanted to bed Helene’s girlfriend and, when rebuffed, took his revenge. The two women were denounced and arrested. Helene, indicted for military subversion, was expelled from the air force and sent to Camp Butzow. This violated regulations because Butzow was specially designated as a penal camp for recalcitrant prisoners of war. It did not matter. She and five lesbians were thrown into an empty cell block, under the command of male constables. <mark fc>“These are the scum of the earth,” the guards are reported to have told the French and Russian POWs. “We wouldn’t fuck them with a sofa leg.”</mark> <mark>The prisoners were promised a rare reward: for each woman they penetrated, they would be given a bottle of schnapps.</mark> This grotesque sport was, of course, a violation of Himmler’s orders concerning the purity of the German race. POWs were to be severely punished for having had, or having tried to have, intercourse with German women. But then, the entire case, like so many others, had no legal foundation and serves only to emphasise the extent to which the SS felt itself to be free of all moral and ethical restraint. In the end, the only law that was respected was the law of the jungle.

In regards to the specific incident described, I could not find how it ended. In a more general sense, this is false; women were raped by their fellow prisoners in the prisons and camps. The second claim seems to be that prisoners sexually assaulted German guards upon liberation, which I also found no evidence for; beating and killing guards, yes, but not that.

Henceforth any SS or police officer engaging in indecent behaviour with another man or allowing himself to be abused by him for indecent purposes was to be condemned to death.</mark> That Himmler had to promulgate such an order suggests that, despite his vigilance, homosexuality within the elite SS had not entirely ceased; indeed, Himmler conceded at one point that he had to deal with one case a month. In February 1942, the Fuhrer’s purity decree was extended to any male engaging in homosexual activities.

Their names may well have landed on the desk of Captain Meisinger. Another means of identifying suspected homosexuals lay in the confiscated subscription lists of about thirty magazines of more or less homosexual orientation then available in larger cities. Although most of these were probably purchased on newsstands, some may have been obtained by subscription. By 1938 and 1939, gay bars, clubs, and organisations had disappeared. Yet informers on all contragenics were constantly being trained. The authorities encouraged every citizen to report on all who exhibited the slightest evidence of deviance. <mark>Moreover, how was it possible for a suspect to prove that he had not thrown an “offensive glance” at another man? In at least one instance, a man was arrested not because he had been watching a young couple make love in a park, but because he had been seen observing the actions of the man more than those of the woman.</mark> Julius Streicher, editor of Der Sturmer, had urged his readers to write to him about Jewish men suspected of having, or trying to establish, relations with non-Jewish women. Denunciatory letters poured in. The same pattern held true for other contragenics. It was easy for anyone who wanted to get rid of a competitor to brand the rival as a homosexual. With one short anonymous note to the local Gestapo branch, the enemy of the state could be taken into protective custody or, at least, thoroughly interrogated.

Even more, in various political and philosophical disguises it was accepted as a basic ideological creed. Thus, the unnatural became the guiding principle."

<mark>According to statistics compiled by the Nazis and discovered after the war’s end, only 3,976 male teenagers between fourteen and eighteen years old, of the more than 25,000 juveniles arrested for crimes against Paragraph 175, were convicted between 1933 and 1940. Since the total of juveniles during this period amounted to about 2.4 million,</mark> this number is relatively small. The legal department of the Hitler Youth had researched the cases of 100,000 juveniles convicted of all sorts of illegal deeds only to discover that on the average; just <mark>forty-seven out of ten thousand</mark> crimes were of a homosexual nature. <mark>This was embarrassing; Schirach, like Himmler, was convinced that homosexuals formed a greater portion of the criminal population.

These figures must be treated with caution. They indicate only the number of people arrested and sentenced for homosexuality; they tell nothing of the truth of that charge.

Okay, the thing about Somerton is that sometimes he will cite his sources and you can just read along and see where he's adding things. He got most of this video from Richard Plant's *The Pink Triangle* and the passage he's quoting from actually says that 15% of the *teenage boys* kicked out of the Hitler Youth were kicked out for being being gay, not the adult leadership. Also, there's nothing in there about any coverups. [...]

Now I have seen [a different article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3704558) arguing that Himmler *maybe* didn't drum out all the gays from the force like he claimed he did, but you know that's more the level of arguing that, you know, the SS was as gay as the general populace, not "so gay" that they were infamous for coercing gay blowjobs from people. [Also the whole idea of gay Nazis is a wildly homophobic myth and you shouldn't spread it](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/08/gay-nazi-myth-why-dinesh-dsouzas-misuse-of-history-is-so-galling.html).

Also, again, gays in the military were not "excused" for "having gay sexual encounters." The book says the exact opposite. Some of the claims that James makes here and in other places are also found in *The Pink Swastika*, a pseudohistorical book written by an anti-gay rightwinger that promotes the gay Nazi myth. The book's claims have been debunked by many historians and other writers. See, for example, [*The Annotated Pink Swastika*](http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/anti/annotated.pink.swastika)

<mark>In 1942, Hitler declared that the armed forces were too lenient in their treatment of sexual deviants.</mark> There was probably more behind this than Hitler’s pleasure in the badgering the military. Himmler, who a year earlier had prescribed the death penalty for any SS member guilty of homosexual actions, had probably pressured Hitler to the armed forces to conform. After all, an SS man caught with a sailor could be executed, while the sailor might get away with one or two years in jail. A psychiatrist, Otto Wuth, was appointed to alert military jurists to the dangers of all types of homosexuality. Wuth, a firm believer in Himmler’s scriptures, disapproved of the distinction between full-time libidinal felons and part-time victims. He labelled every male indulging in any type of same-sex activities a “compulsive psychopath,” and sought to prove that most homosexuals had previous criminal records of one sort or another. Should men convicted of homosexual felonies be dismissed from the armed forces? Wuth thought not. He proposed to put them instead into penal combat battalions where they had to face direct enemy fire. Wuth argued that if genuine psychopaths were discharged from the fighting forces. Heterosexual malingerers might pretend to be libidinal felons and use this ruse to get out of service. For repeat offenders, Wuth recommended demotion in rank for minor violations, and strict prison sentences for major crimes; all criminals were to wear a visible badge denoting their status.

Basically, Eicke worked out two sets of rules, one for camp personnel, one for inmates. Of the code for guards, only certain sections were put on paper; much of it was passed on through indoctrination sessions. Foremost, he insisted on unconditional obedience. Every order by a superior officer had to be carried out. Frequently he emphasised “that every prisoner be treated with fanatical hatred as an enemy of the state.” <mark>Eicke developed a set of procedures that would breed in the guards a conviction that they were not only carrying out legitimate orders but punishing dangerous subversives.

The hormone tests, however, can stand as a model for virtually all of those tests carried out by the Nazis on their human guinea pigs. <mark>These experiments brought illness and death to the subjects and had no scientific value.</mark> Often, physicians and laboratory technicians did not know how to proceed; files and samples were incomplete or misplaced; medicine could not be checked for purity; and there was no control group. In the case at hand, Allied bombers repeatedly destroyed containers carrying blood, urine, and other specimens in transit from Buchenwald to Vaernet’s laboratory in Prague.

I cannot find any evidence of experiments that match James' description. Gay men were certainly experimented on in the camps with castration and hormones, and their calcium levels were checked before and after castration in 1944 according to *The Pink Triangle*, but I could not find anything regarding hormones making someone impervious to pain, or "target practice" being involved, or men with low calcium levels being executed.

He talked about "patiently carrying one's burden" and feeling shame about his imprisonment because he was imprisoned as a homosexual.<sup>88</sup> It was because of this shame that he never spoke to his mother about what had happened to him for over eight years. So much of his life and torture had to be repressed and kept a secret from everyone because he felt shame and was unsure how people would react. <mark>This was a common theme between many of the homosexual survivors of the Holocaust. They were shamed into silence.</mark> Their experience went unheard for many years because no one wanted to hear it, and they felt ashamed to tell it.

Of those men, it is estimated that around 15,000 were murdered.<sup>97</sup></mark> <mark>Exact numbers cannot be known because the Nazis often kept poor records and burned many of them when they knew their end was near. Many prisoners were quickly liquidated without accurate documentation of their deaths. All of these men suffered under the Nazis and should be remembered when discussing the Holocaust.

<mark>Before the Nazis came to power, Germany was experiencing more sexual liberation than ever before, especially in Berlin.</mark> There were many gay clubs and organizations, starting to work towards gay rights, specifically the repeal of Paragraph 175 which criminalized homosexuality. <mark>These "Golden Twenties" were cut short by the Nazis, who strengthened Paragraph 175 and started to persecute more and more homosexuals, and other men who they just believed to be homosexuals. They raided and burned Magnus Herschfield's Institute of Sexual Research,</mark> and assassinated Ernst Rohem, one of Hitler's closest confidants, who flaunted his homosexuality too freely. Homosexuality, especially within the Nazi party itself, was seen as a threat to the patriarchal behaviors of the party.

<mark>Gay men were thrown into separate barracks in the camps, and forced to do some of the most excruciating labor, often resulting in death, and were often seen as the lowest of the prisoners, even by others in the camps.

<mark>Homosexual men were thrown into separate barracks in the camps, and forced to do some of the most excruciating labor, which often resulted in death. They were severely punished, and were often seen as the lowest of the prisoners, even by the other prisoners. They often had medical experiments done to them that affected them and shamed them even after they were liberated, if the experiments didn't kill them first.</mark> While lesbians weren't specifically persecuted, many of them still ended up mthe camps and faced discrimination, even though their treatment was not as brutal. This was because it was thought that they could just be forced into carrying out the Nazis will of Aryan procreation.

<mark>After the Holocaust, homosexual victims were often shamed into silence about their treatment in the camps.</mark> They faced renewed discrimination and potentially even imprisonment if they said why they were in the camps. They did not feel comfortable pushing for reparations and memorials until almost 50 years after they were liberated. Even today, they are still not well recognized or compensated. Only recently have we been able to get some testimony from homosexual survivors, many of whom did not want to be identified. <mark>The homosexual victims of the Holocaust deserve respect and recognition for all of their sufferings within the camps. Their voices should be heard and their stories should be taught along with the other victims of the Holocaust. If we continue to ignore or silence their voices, we are letting the Nazis win,</mark> and are contributing to the homosexual victim's shame and victimization. It is important to keep the memory of these victims alive, especially as we enter into a time when many of our homosexual survivors are dying off, some of their stories never heard.

In many ways, the spectres of the Third Reich still haunt us. The spectres begin to come to life whenever fanatics of any sect try to take over a nation and call for a war against its most vulnerable and vilified minorities. Since the end of World War II and the discovery of the Nazi death machine, every modern nation across the globe has spoken the same mantras: 

> "It could never happen here." 

> [and] "Never again."

<mark yikes stat:id="y-persecution">Western Nations have decried countries as backwards when they begin murdering giant portions of their own populations - Jewish people, Muslims, racial minorities and ethnic groups. But when gay people are being arrested, hung, shot, drowned, and decapitated in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Chechnya, Russia, Syria, Uganda... Our political leaders, our representatives, feign offense but do nothing about it.</mark> <mark fc=false>They may threaten sanctions, but no one will go to war to save the gays.</mark> And so we have to save ourselves.

His emphasis that Western politicians care about ethnic cleansings, but not persecution against gay people, is... well, incorrect. I don't know quite how to word this, but it's just... weird to claim that racial minorities have it better than gay people in regards to world politics or whatever.

It's also just wrong? Western countries [have condemned anti gay legislations.](https://www.kff.org/news-summary/western-countries-continue-to-react-to-ugandas-anti-gay-law/) I know in particular Brunei [initially put a hold] on execution of gay people because [Westerners boycotted the state-supported hotels in Western countries](https://eastasiaforum.org/2020/04/24/bruneis-stoning-for-gay-sex-law-flies-under-the-radar/). Like I agree Western countries can, and should do more for LGBTQ people, but it's just wrong to claim they do nothing.

We have to do what we can to get gay men and women and trans people out of countries that would see them murdered by the state, get them away from vicious leaders who would rather see them riddled with bullets than holding hands. We must learn the lessons that were taught in Europe, and then we must mean it. 

We must act... when we say... "Never again."
