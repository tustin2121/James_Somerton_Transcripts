Queer Baiting

<james vid {% include timecode %}>

<span visual>The queer community has become incredibly good at finding queer subtext in movies and TV shows, whether it exists or not. For over a century of film and television, we've probably been the most underrepresented minority in media. It was never illegal for a character of color to exist in a movie, but it *was* illegal, for a long time, for a queer character to exist.</span> Writers, directors, and producers could be taken to court under obscenity laws, fined and even jailed, for having the nerve to show a queer character. 

<span visual>At the same time, it's become a culturally agreed upon fact among cis-straight people, to the point of parody, that the queer community runs Hollywood. The Velvet or Pink Mafia, supposedly now run by David Geffin, is even an assumed queer media cartel that inserts LGBT messaging into movies and TV shows to corrupt the youth of America.</span>

The funny thing is, this isn't entirely false. I mean, we're not trying to corrupt the youth of America; growing up alone in the suburbs is doing a fine job of that all on its own. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<span visual>But there has always been a loose collective of queer creators that *do* insert coding into a lot of movies, TV shows, and books, coding that would likely be ignored by straight audiences but immediately recognized by those of us who are on the lookout. It's reached a bit of a fever pitch lately, with Poe and Finn, Steve and Bucky, *Teen Wolf*, *The Legend of Kora*, and even *Frozen*. But just because people outside queer spaces are finally recognizing it doesn't mean it's a new thing. What we now call queer baiting has been around since the early days of cinema. Sort of.</span> Film historians have given the early days of this phenomenon the name "queer coding", which a lot of people confuse with "queer baiting", but there is a big difference between the two. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

"Queer coding" is when you're unable to show actual queer characters on screen, either because of the laws or morals of the day, or because studio executives just won't let you. So you create characters that the right audience will *obviously* view as gay, lesbian, bi, or transgender, to allow for LGBT representation when the entire world is telling you not to. A little golden nugget hidden deep underground for the people who are willing to dig for it. 

<span visual>While "queer baiting" is when you *do* have the ability to add queer characters to your film or TV show, but just don't want to risk turning off certain audiences or advertisers by doing so. One is an effort to give LGBT audiences at least a taste of representation, while the other is used to reel in said audience with an implied promise of queer characters without ever actually intending on fulfilling that promise.</span>

It's like the cinematic equivalent of edging without the money shot.
{% assign timecode = "2:51" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

<span visual>So let's look at the history of this practice, discover media you may not know is intended to be read as queer, see when the line between queer coding and queer baiting began to blur, and why we still don't have an out LGBT superhero in the MCU.</span>

<wbr on />A long time ago, in a Hollywood Far Far Away, gay characters were not all that uncommon. But they were played for laughs. In the early days of silent film, movies like *A Florida Enchantment*, *Algae the Minor*, and *The Soilers* featured gay characters as easy comic relief. The idea of homosexuality was even a gag in *Behind the Screen*, an early Charlie Chaplain film that showed him kissing a tomboy and being mocked for it. Being mocked by someone whose eye makeup could make Trixie Mattel blush.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It was around this time that that the "sissy" stereotype was born: flouncy, bouncy, frilly men with creative jobs. Artists, designers... This grew out of the self-hatred among straight men who found it hard to provide for their families in lean times. You weren't a man if you couldn't support a wife and three kids. You weren't a man if you couldn't go off to war. So to appeal to the egos of these (quote-unquote) "real men", producers created characters to make them feel better about their masculinity. Movies like *Our Betters*, *The Broadway Melody*, *Meron Merge*, and *Call Her Savage* were just a few films with such characters.<wbr off />

This type of representation of gay men was not appreciated.

This wasn't the only representation though. <wbr on />The 1927 film *Wings* featured a...<wbr off /> a very intense friendship between two pilots that culminates in this scene:

But scenes like that were few and far between. So while gay men were played for laughs, lesbians were something else entirely. 

<wbr on />Marina Dietrich turned on both men and women with this scene in 1930s *Morocco*. A woman in a tuxedo wasn't entirely unheard of coming out of the Roaring 20s, but a woman in a tuxedo on film? That was groundbreaking. The lesbian kiss, a cherry on top. Gary Cooper may have been Dietrich's real love interest in the film, but everybody left the theater talking about that scene.

Not long after *Morocco*, we got *Queen Christina* the story of a realife Swedish Monarch who was infamous for being a,,, pretty out and proud lesbian for the day, though the filmmakers went out of their way to straightwash the historical figure, her real life sexuality bled onto the celluloid despite their best efforts.

Along with homosexuality, sex, violence, and orgies were pretty common in early Hollywood, oddly in biblical films. And some people we're getting fed up with it.<wbr off />

Starting in 1922, after the earliest of these morally questionable films had become massive successes, and a series of real life Hollywood scandals had rocked the papers, studio heads enlisted William H. Hayes, the former Postmaster General (so he was obviously qualified) to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. He was one of the few unindighted members of Warren G. Harding's administration at the time, so obviously his moral fortitude was robust.

<wbr on />In 1924, he ented introduced a set of recommendations dubbed "The Formula", which Studios were advised to strictly follow. Back in 1915, the Supreme Court case *Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio* had already decided that Free Speech laws didn't extend to Motion Pictures, stating that<wbr off /> "because film may be used for evil, we cannot regard censorship as beyond the power of the government". So the industry was on thin ice as it was. It could be a *disaster* for them to draw the ire of conservatives in government. Directors and writers, though, mostly ignored the suggestions.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In 1927, Hayes strongly suggested Studios form a committee to discuss film censorship. The heads of MGM and Fox complied and created a list of "don't"s and "be careful"s. This oddball list included things like:

\[Displayed on screen, read out word for word]:

> Pointed profanity -- by either title or lip -- this includes the words "God", "Lord", "Jesus", "Christ" (unless they be used reverently in connection with the proper religious ceremonies), "hell", "damn", "Gawd" and every other profane and vulgar expression however it may be spelled;

> Any licentious or suggestive nudity -- in fact or in silhouette, and any lecherous or licentious notice thereof by other characters in the picture;

> The illegal traffic of drugs;

> Any inference of sex perversion;

> White slavery 

(but not black slavery, that was fine!)

> Miscegenation [or] (sexual relationship between the races);

> Sex Hygiene and Venial Diseases

> Scenes of actual childbirth -- in fact or in silhouette; as long as it isn't shown on screen

> Children's sex organs

(okay this one actually, you know, makes sense)

> Ridicule of the clergy;

> willful offense to any nation, race or creed;

(I feel like not *all* races were included in that)

> Special care should also be taken when portraying the use of firearms, the American flag, men and women sharing a bed, and actual murder[s].

So it was relatively okay to show *actual murder*, but even the idea, *the inference*, of homosexuality was a big no-no.

Many writers and directors in Hollywood, many of them gay themselves were, not too happy with the implementation of the Hays Code. Especially since in places like Weimar Republic Germany, advancement of queer representation on film was becoming mainstream. At least until the rise of Adolf Hitler. They saw what little progress that was taking place in North American Cinema come to a screeching halt with the Hays Code introduction, and they decided to fight back against it any way they could. And the only way they could at the time was to create characters that were quite obviously gay to any queer person watching, but who could fly under the radar of the censors.

<wbr on />One way to get the censors to turn the other way was to code villains as gay. Such as the obsessive Mrs Danverse and Alfred Hitchcock's *Rebecca*. After the titular Rebecca dies, it is revealed to the audience that her housekeeper Mrs danverse has kept all of her clothes, with a special care given to her underwear.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Another example is 1941's *The Maltese Falcon*. In the film, Peter Lori plays Joel Cairo, one of the film's villains. In the book on which it's based, Cairo is stated very clearly to be gay, queer in fact, but in the movie it's instead inferred, with his business card being sprayed with perfume, a lilting feminine demeanor, and his propensity to orally fondle his cane.

<wbr off />This trend of coding villains as gay lasted for decades, a topic I covered more in depth in my [Monsters in the Closet video](4zPCM14-SCQ.md). <wbr on />Sometimes the censors would turn a blind eye to lesbians on the screen, but only under certain circumstance. The "lesbian prison movie" became almost a cliche in the 1940s and 50s, killing two birds with one stone: scaring girls into following the law lest they end up in prison with big scary lesbians, and convincing many young lesbians to go straight, since lesbians seem to have no fate *but* to end up in prison.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Lesbians in these movies tended to be played by large imposing women, and they likely had a position of authority within the prison. not guards or anything like that, God forbid, but the women who had been in prison the longest had relationships with the guards. and so the guards were more likely to turn a blind eye to their sapphic tendencies.

representation of queer women was more subtle in 1950s *Young Man With A Horn*, but just barely. Lauren Bacall plays Amy, an obviously bisexual character that becomes a chaotic force in the life of our main character, Rick. while observing Doris Day's Joe Jordan, Amy comments:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.celluoid_closet %}>

Amy: "It was interesting, isn't she? So simple and uncomplicated. Must be wonderful to wake up in the morning and know just which door you're going to walk through. But she's so terribly normal."

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

She's referred to by other characters as having a twisted mind, and eventually Rick tells her that she's sick; this description falling into the prevailing medical opinion on homosexuality at the time.

<james {% include timecode %}>

An iconic example of queer coding that straddles the line of Hays Code approval is 1955's *Rebel Without a Cause*. Starring two teen heartthrobs, James Dean and Sal Mineo, both of whom are at least *rumored* to have been queer. Dean's character Jim is a teenager kicking against authority and parental neglect. Who becomes both friend and fascination to Mineo's Plato, a lonely younger kid. 

Plato is obviously gay, although it's easier to say that in 2020 than it was in 1955. If you don't pick up on that from the photo of hunky Alan Ladd that Plato has taped inside of his locker, or the looks of adoration he gives Jim, it becomes *abundantly* clear when he makes a coded declaration of love to Jim late in the film. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.rebel_without_cause %}>

Jim: "No? Not ready to come out yet?"

Plato: (verge of tears) "No."

Jim: "No? Okay. Promise you nothing will happen if you do."

Plato: (shaking head) "No."

Jim: "Are you cold? Here." (takes off jacket) "It's warm. Here. My jacket; it's warm."

Plato: (deer-in-the-headlights look) "Can I keep it?"

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Jim has feelings for Plato too, although the main narrative is him falling in love with Natalie Wood's character Judy. James Dean could read the subtext though. prior to filming the intense encounter with Mineo in the abandoned Getty Mansion, he told him, "look at me the way that *I* look at Natalie". 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Such homoerotic bonding couldn't be spoken about in the repressive 1950s. Being gay was still illegal in most of the country, and at minimum frowned upon everywhere else, and the censors of the day took pains to keep it that way. A production code officer sent a memo to Jack Warner in the spring of 1955 during the filming of *Rebel Without a Cause*, reminding the Warner Brothers executive that--<wbr off />

\[on screen, radio filter]:
> "it is of course vital that there be no inference of a questionable or homosexual relationship between Plato and Jim."

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.rebel_without_cause %}>

<wbr on />\[Plato and Jim close a garage door]

Plato: "Hey, you want to come home with me? I mean, there's nobody home at my house and, heck, I'm not tired. Are you?"

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>


Now *that's* some *subtle* inference. 😏

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<wbr on />Most straight reviewers of *Rebel* didn't pick up on anything beyond "Boy Meets Girl" and the romantic entanglements. the strongest impact the film makes is non-verbal, operating on an unconscious level. the mere sight of Dean and Mineo exhibiting unabashed love for each other sent a powerful message. Dean's Jim isn't afraid to show affection for Plato as well as Judy. as Brave as the filmmakers were to show a pretty blatant example of a gay, or at least questioningly gay, relationship on screen, they knew the strict morals of the day might take the picture down.

So Plato, the more obviously gay of the two characters, has to die in the end. He can't live happily ever after. He can't live at all. Can't give the impression that that kind of lifestyle could result in anything but pain and death. James Dean would die in a car accident before the film was even released. And... Sal Mineo would be stabbed to death in West Hollywood at the age of 37. <wbr off />

And now for an abrupt segue!
{% assign timecode = "16:27" %}

<wbr on />You wouldn't expect expect there to be queer coding in *Ben-Hur*, of all movies -- the book was subtitled "The Tale of the Christ" -- but there actually is. Gore Vidal, screenwriter of the film, said this in 1996:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.celluoid_closet %}>

Gore Vidal (being interviewed): "Let's say that these two guys, when they were 15-16 when they last saw each other, they had been lovers, and now they're meeting again, and the Roman wants to start it up. Messala, played by Steven Boyd, wants to started up again with Ben-Hur, played by Charlton Heston, heaven knows why, but he does. Anyway, he's Roman.

Vidal: "So, uh, Willie stared at me, face gray, and I said 'well, I'll never use the word, there'll be nothing overt, but it'll be perfectly clear that Messala is in love with Ben-Hur.'

Vidal: "Willie said 'Gore, this is Ben-Hur. A Tale of the Christ, I think is the subtitle,' he said rather vaguely looking around. And Willie finally said, 'Well, it's certainly better than what we've got. We'll try.'"

\[Playing clip from Ben-Hur, music swelling]

Messala: (laughing, clasping hands with Ben-Hur) "After all these years! Still close!"

Ben-Hur: "In every way." (chuckling)

Vidal (being interviewed): "He said, 'Have you talked to anybody about this?' and I said 'No.' He said, 'You talk to Boyd (Messala). Uh... don't say *anything* to Heston, because Chuck will fall apart. I'll take care of him.'" (laugh-snort) "So Heston he's doing 'Francis X Bushman'. In the silent version, his head is always constantly on high like this and like this." (demonstrating)

Vidal: "And Steven Boyd is acting it *to pieces*. There are looks that he gives him that are just *so clear*."

\[Playing clip from Ben-Hur]

Messala: (giving one of said looks) "I said I'd come back."

Ben-Hur: "I never thought you wouldn't."<wbr off />

The bisexual overtones of "snails and oysters" was too obvious even for the pretty oblivious censors of the day.

And even more egregiously with another Tennessee Williams adaptation *Suddenly Last Summer*. <wbr on />Screenwriter Gore Vidal (...seemed to be writing a lot of these movies at the time) said the film was forced before the legion of decency and cut to bits until it made no sense at all. But the messaging, though now coded, was still there. That the unseen character of Sebastian used the women in his life to attract men he could sleep with, ending in his violent murder by a savage mob.

When the film was released, the New York Times ran a *scathing* review, telling potential movie goers "if you'd like incest, rape, sodomy, cannibalism, degeneracy, this *sickening* picture is the the one for you." <wbr off />*Inadvertently* they had given the film the best advertising campaign it could possibly hope for! Making it a *breakaway* success for stars Elizabeth Taylor and Katharine Hepburn.

<wbr on />Coding went out *the window* with 1961's *Victim*, giving filmgoers their first gay hero. And a sympathetic betrayal of homosexuals in general. The British film was attacked by censors in the UK and the US. with UK censors giving it an X rating and America's production code refusing to classify at all. Decades later, when it was eventually released on home video?<wbr off /> It was rated PG-13.

<wbr on />As the production code slowly began to fade away in America, with original restrictions like open-mouth kissing, nudity, profanity, abortion, and prostitution now finding their way through the censoring process, only one remained: the sex perversion clause.

<wbr off />No major studios and stars had yet tackled the subject of homosexuality in any meaningful way in Hollywood... But that would change with 1961's *The Children's Hour* <wbr on />starring Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The film was willing to show that, yes, homosexuality *is a thing*, it *does exist*, but it's not something good moral people should talk about. MacLaine and Hepburn play two friends, Martha and Karen, who opened a private school for girls. When one of their students, a vicious little bully, is punished by Karen by not allowing her to attend that weekend's boat race, the little wretch concocts a story about the two women being lesbians and tells her grandmother. This leads to a series of ever escalating circumstances, including a lawsuit, that leave the two women emotionally drained. And Karen's engagement (to a man) left in limbo. 

But even after the accusation has proven false, their lives are not the same. Karen's fiance leaves, so Karen wants to leave town for good start a new life somewhere else. A fevered back and forth leads to Martha realizing that she actually does *love* Karen, and not just as friends. She's *in* love with her best friend and feels *terrible* about it. She feels responsible for ruining their lives and is disgusted by her feelings for Karen. And so one day while Karen is out for a walk...<wbr off /> Martha hangs herself.

The film was nominated for five Academy Awards and is considered one of the best courtroom dramas ever made, but its Legacy is not quite so positive. The entire movie is about how horrible it would be for two nice young women to be lesbians, just the idea of it leads people to gasp, and end with one of them killing herself. Homosexuality was not really a part of the movie, it was only a negative plot device. How people are treated when accused of a crime so heinous. The lesbian experience isn't really expressed in the film at all, and even Shirley MacLaine has gone on record in 1996 saying William Wyler, the director, never even *spoke* to her about the lesbian elements.

But though the film's depiction of homosexuality and reactions to it are flawed, it still rings true to many. people still live in environments where they're called "sick" and "dirty" for being gay, either by those around them or by depictions of queer people in the media. So Martha's self-loathing is *all* too familiar to *many* people. After *The Children's Hour*, movies about queer self-loathing became more frequent.

It wasn't the end of gay coding, but gay stereotypes began to replace it. There would still be stereotypical gay portrayals across *every* genre of film: Butch lesbians, feminine men, and *sneaky* bisexual and transgender people.

By the new millennium, the queer audience was one the producers, mostly on TV but some movies, were willing to appeal to. <wbr on />*Will and Grace* became a smash hit for NBC. *Queer as Folk* and *The L-Word* broke ratings records for showtime. And *Queer Eye For The Straight Guy* became a cultural sensation/ In Hollywood *Kissing Jessica Stein* became a surprise hit. *The Hours* was an award season darling, and *Brokeback Mountain* made $178 million, breaking the hearts of movie goers around the world in the process.

But it wasn't all roses. TV networks faced advertiser boycotts and people picketed movie theater showing *Brokeback Mountain*. There was money to be made by appealing to the LGBT community, but it came with great risk. That risk was compounded by a string of queer inclusive bombs like *Running With Scissors*, under-performers like *Milk*, and gay backlash toward movies like *Bruno* and *I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry*. 

The queer audience was a volatile one. One that wouldn't accept just any movie you gave them. And if you directly appealed to the queer audience, you ran the real risk of turning off the straights. So producers and writers needed to figure out a way to appeal to the gays without putting off the heteros. And they looked to a burgeoning internet fan community to find the answers.

The Harry Potter series of books and movies had birthed Harry / Draco slash fiction, on online forums, and was becoming a massive trend with stories and art spreading all over the internet. Although the characters have almost no positive interactions at all in the books or movies, let alone romantic ones, fans were drawing romantic conclusions from breadcrumbs that really didn't even exist. This is when creators realized that the queer community would do the work for you. They'd fill in the LGBT-shaped blanks and all you had to do was drop a few hints. And leave a few empty spaces. And straight audiences be none the wiser. 

And so, gay-bating was born.

## Part Two: Taking the Bait

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Now here's where I lay out a little caveat for you. In doing my research for this, I found enough instances of gay baiting to fill a whole book, let alone a video. So I decided to break it down into eight instances that stood out amongst the rest. These got the most media attention and the most fanfiction and the most fan attention. 

I'm also not going to be covering any queer baiting that was eventually made canonical, like with *The Legend Of Korra* and *Adventure Time*. That's actually called queer catching, which is when a character's queerness is confirmed *after* a media franchise has finished and therefore you're not running the possibility of impacting its ratings or its sales. Or you reveal that a character is gay on a press tour for a movie but it's never really manifests in the movie itself. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The most infamous example of this would be a certain British author confirming that Dumbledore was gay after her book series had ended. But she doubled down by *actually* queerbaiting him in a future film installment. But we're not done talking about her and her Wizards. Oh no. Not yet.

An interesting trend in queer baiting is that slightly more loose rules apply to lesbian characters. When two female characters are queer they may actually end up coupling up in the end of the story. This is of course because according to market research (and I work in marketing so I know this), male and female audiences are both more okay with lesbian characters than gay characters. While straight male audiences are likely to turn off immediately when two male characters turn out to be gay. It's even shown that parents are more likely to be okay with their kids seeing a lesbian couple than a gay couple. The assumption, at least among media researchers, is that it's easy for heteronormative audiences to view lesbian couples asexually, since there's technically no penetrative sex. Unless you *actually* know a lesbian and know that sex toys exist.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But even then, lesbian characters are only likely to be confirmed to be queer at the end of the story if not afterwards in some other form of media, uh novels, comic books, stuff like that. Again, this happened with *The Legend Of Korra*, notoriously. It also *almost* happened very recently with the new incarnation of *She-Ra*, but they got that lesbian confirmation in *right* under the wire. And of course, that research doesn't cover everyone and there are plenty of people who find lesbians just as disgusting as gay men. 

The acceptance of lesbians in mainstream culture is just slightly more prevalent, mostly thanks to Ellen's brand of family safe gayness. *But* if anyone of you wants to share some videos or articles that cover lesbian queer baiting that I might have missed, please share them with me and I will link them in the description below. And I just want everyone to know... I tried to include *Supernatural*, I did, but try as I might I could not follow that show at all, it makes no sense!

So now that the caveats are out of the way...

And although that may seem like a bad thing for a love-struck Merlin, <mark x>it helps him believe that maybe Arthur can learn to love a servant</mark>. His relationship with Gwen gives him hope.

Sherlock began its on-again-off-again run on the BBC in 2010. A modern reimagining of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Victorian mystery novels, Sherlock explores the lives of the residents of 221 B. Baker Street London. Those being John Watson and Sherlock Holmes.

The gay question is actually brought up before they even move in together.

</james>
<from span="2" {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.aretheygay_sherlock at="(1:35)" %}>

John has always questioned Sherlock's sexuality. In fact, when they first meet, it's one of the first things to come out.

> Watson: "You don't have a girlfriend then?"
> 
> Sherlock: "Girlfriend? No, not really my area."
> 
> Watson: "Alright." "Do you have a boyfriend?" "Which is fine by the way-" 
> 
> Sherlock: "I know it's fine."

> Sherlock: "No."
> 
> Watson: "Alright, okay." (licks lips) 
> 
> \[Avila adds "lick" on screen]
> 
> Watson: "No one attached, just like me."

John assumed that Sherlock was gay when he said that women weren't his area and Sherlock didn't even deny the question of having a boyfriend right away. Instead he went right away to saying he knows it's fine. 

</from>
<clip visual={{atg}} on="1:40" off="2:00" {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.sherlock %}>

Watson: "You don't have a girlfriend then?"

Sherlock: "Girlfriend? No, not really my area."

Watson: (staring in concern) "Alright... Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine by the way--"

Sherlock: "I know it's fine."

Watson: (quickly) "You you got a boyfriend--"

Sherlock: "No."

Watson: "Right, okay."

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<mark num=1>Sherlock then does assume John is coming on to him</mark>, and <mark num=2>explains he's too wrapped up in his work to be in a relationship</mark>. While this could easily be read as a fun misunderstanding, <mark num=3>Sherlock is a *master* at reading people.</mark> He's practically psychic at times. <mark num=4>So if he read the situation as if John had a hard-on for him... well, maybe he did!</mark> 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.aretheygay_sherlock at="(2:41)" %}>

And then Sherlock goes on to reject John coming on to Sherlock by saying:

> Sherlock: "John, um, I think you should know that <mark num=2>I consider myself married to my work</mark> and while I'm flattered by your interest, I'm really not looking for any-" 
> 
> Watson: "No, I'm not asking- No. I'm just saying, it's all fine."  
\[End clip]

<mark num=1>Sherlock assumed that John was interested</mark>. Sherlock isn't stupid. He knows when people are romantically attached to him. He knows the science of attraction. <mark num=3>He's the master of body language and deduction</mark>, <mark num=4>so why did he read John as coming on to him? Maybe it was because he was.</mark>

Let's also think about the beginning of the restaurant scene. <mark x>When Angelo first brought John and Sherlock their food, he assumes that John is his date.</mark>

> Waiter: "Sherlock. Anything on the menu, whatever you want: free. On the house for you, and for your date." 
> 
> Sherlock: "Do you want to eat?" 
> 
> Watson: "I'm not his date." 

And Sherlock brushes it off and doesn't even comment about it. But why would Angelo assume John is Sherlock's date? Surely Angelo and Sherlock have a long history together since Angelo and Sherlock are both very friendly to each other. So, after all these years Angelo made the conclusion that Sherlock is attracted to men? <mark num=2>And Sherlock doesn't even deny it</mark>, he just went with the flow. 

Who else has known Sherlock for a long time? His landlady, Mrs. Hudson. And she assumed that Sherlock and John were a couple too:

> Watson: "I've met someone."
> 
> Landlady: (squeal, claps hands) "Oh, lovely!"
> 
> Watson: "Yeah, we're getting married. Well, I'm gonna ask anyway."
> 
> Landlady: "So soon after Sherlock?"
> 
> Watson: "Hm, well yes."
> 
> Landlady: (smile falters for a few seconds) "What's his name?"
> 
> Watson: (sighs) "It's a woman."
> 
> Landlady: "A woman?!"
> 
> Watson: "Yes, of course, it's a woman!"
> 
> Landlady: (laughs) "You really have moved on, haven't you?"
> 
> Watson: "Mrs. Hudson! How many times? Sherlock was NOT my boyfriend."
> 
> Landlady: "Live and let live, that's my motto."

<clip visual={{atg}} on="4:17" off="4:25" {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.sherlock %}>

Waiter: "Sherlock... anything on the menu whatever you want, free. On 'e house for you and for your date."

<mark>The play moves on to follow the lives of our two boys over the next few years. Focused obviously on Albus</mark>, since he's Harry Potter's kid and all. 

We learned more about Albus's life at home, his awkward relationship with his family -- <mark x>he feels like he doesn't fit in</mark>, especially after being <mark>sorted into Slytherin</mark> with a family entirely made up of Gryffindors. 

Same for Scorpius: he doesn't live up to his father's expectations either. He's a bit weird, kind of a goofball, which doesn't fly with the Malfoy family.

<mark>As this play goes on, it follows Albus and Scorpius's lives over the next few years. Mainly focusing on Albus</mark> because, you know son of... main character.

We start to explore Albus's past, his relationship with his father, Harry, and the tension there. Albus has a lot to live up to under his father's name, And <mark>he feels like a black sheep in the Potter family</mark> at every turn. He's <mark>sorted into *Slytherin*</mark> while his family are notoriously from the Gryffindor house, He and his friends are outcasts, 

Both Scorpius and Albus don't live up to other people's expectations. <mark>but they still have each other.</mark> And despite the other relationships that are built in this story, Albus and Scorpius's story is the heart of the play. Their need for each other is emphasized throughout the story.

<mark x>Harry *tried* to make Albus feel welcome</mark>, but he just doesn't understand his son. It's an easy allegory for parents of queer kids trying to be accepting, but they're just can't get it right. <mark>Scorpius is the only person that Albus feels comfortable with.</mark>

Albus *will not* hug his father or family. But he'll hug Scorpius. F<mark>iercely. With passion.</mark>

<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.aretheygay_cursed at="(3:19)" %}>

So going back to Albus's narrative <mark>Harry tries to reconcile things with a son</mark>, but there's a disconnect. Albus still feels like an outsider like he's not enough for his dad. <mark>The only person he's comfortable with is... Scorpius.</mark>

At the start of their fourth year, they share a moment of intimacy, one that Albus doesn't really show with other people.

That is a unique thing between them. Albus is desperate for someone to care for, and when he believed that no one else could give him love. He turns in desperation to Scorpius. He hugs him. And not only hugs him, but note the language: <mark>With Fierceness. That is passion.</mark> A passion we have only seen for Scorpius so far.

So, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has said there will never be a *Cursed Child* movie. (Which Warner Brothers might disagree with considering how well this play is doing.) But, I think she's right. Because no one will be able to watch this movie and not see these two boys as gay, no matter *how many* no-homo endings, you tag<sup class="add">[sic: tack]</sup> on. Honestly, Harry-Draco helped kind of helped create modern gay fan fiction, and then Albus and Scorpius were *this close* to making a version of it canon. *This close.* 

I am thoroughly convinced that at some point in the writing process, the playwrights *did* intend on them being gay. And it got switched somewhere along the line. It's not unheard of, it's not the first time that's happened.

## Ocean's Eleven
{% assign timecode = "1:00:25" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

The reboot / sequel to *The Ocean's Eleven* franchise stars an amazing, almost *all* female cast, including Sandra Bullock, Kate Blanchett, Aquafina, Sarah Palson, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter... the first time I watched the movie, I was honestly shocked at how a major movie with some of the *biggest* stars in the *world*... had two lesbian leading characters. But then the movie ended and... oh, they're not lesbians. I call bullshit.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Debbie Ocean, played by Sandra Bulock, and Lou, played by Kate Blanchett, are essentially a couple. I don't care if it's never stated in the movie. They're a couple. Or at least they *were* a couple before Debbie landed in the slammer. And I wasn't the only one who saw this. Queer people around the world noticed it. Even straight people!

One could even argue that this movie is meant to set straight women onto the proper path of lesbianism and crime. But nothing of the sort is ever stated outright in the movie. So... why did so many people read it that way?

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well first off, Blanchett's character is coded extremely gay. The outfits that she wears are crafted to queer perfection. But if you look past the aesthetic glory of the film, you'll see that there's a real love between Debbie and Lou. Coming at this film with a queer lens, I initially felt like the filmmakers were saying it without actually saying it, giving us queer characters whose whole point in life isn't just being queer characters. While telling about her history of running Cons with Lou, Debbie refers to Lou as as her partner. Business partner? Life partner? Yes.

When recalling a rock bottom moment for the two, when they were pulling scams at a retirement home's bingo night, Debbie refers to this as their "rough patch". Were they strapped for cash? Or on the Rocks romantically? Again, yes. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Queer people would read this phrasing as an obvious admission of their lesbian relationship, while straight people would just read it as "awww, they're such good friends." Because straight people can be *clueless* like that. <mark fc>There's actually a term for this obliviousness in the gay community, it's called "The Great Straight Divide"</mark>, when straight people are so clueless, they actually believe that two men are roommates or two women who have lived together for 20 years are "gal pals".

</james>
<comment id="historians">
{% include header for=tustin %}

I have never heard of this term before in my life. I've also asked and several other people in the Former Fans discord have never heard of this term either.

It's definitely a thing that online queer people make fun of all the time, but usually in terms of, like, "historians", eg, ["Historians will say that they were Just Friends"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kqkmk3/historians_say_they_were_just_friends_but_they/) or ["I'm the historian"](https://www.reddit.com/r/aaaaaaacccccccce/comments/vhrzj2/were_all_the_historian_once_in_a_while/) (and obligatory mention of [/r/SapphoAndHerFriend](https://www.reddit.com/r/SapphoAndHerFriend/) and [/r/AchillesAndHisPal](https://www.reddit.com/r/AchillesAndHisPal/)).

Additionally, there's physical flirtation between the duo. In a diner, Sandra spoon feeds Kate a bite of her food, in a very intimate "Lady and the Tramp"-esque manner. I don't know about you, but I never delicately placed sporkfuls<sup class="add">[sic: placed forkfuls]</sup> of diner food onto my platonic friend's tongues.

Whenever the duo interacts it's clear there's a shared intimacy between them that the other women in the crew don't experience with each other. So for me nothing about their relationship points to just being friends. And honestly, I could keep going on but it's actually been confirmed. Sarah Edwards, costume designer, for the movie said in an interview after the film's release:

\[Quote from above now placed correctly, scrolling on screen]:
> "You know, early there was an idea that Lou and Debbie having been in a relationship might be the case, but we seemed to move away from that the shooting went on."

So when they started production, Lou and Debbie had been in a relationship, but by the time they'd wrapped, that was no longer the case. Secret lesbians confirmed. Now give me a sequel so they can kiss already!

Oh God, here we go...

<wbr on />Hitting TV screens in 2011, the MTV show became famous for its propensity to show nearly naked men in nearly every episode. Maybe it was their way of paying reparations for the "I'm not a fag. I'm a werewolf" line from the 1985 movie. The whole show is pretty gay, if we're being honest, kind of like a teenage version of *True Blood* in more ways than one, but the relationship that drove the series into will-they-won't-they territory was between lovable nerd Stiles and brooding alpha werewolf Derek. Fondly known online by the couple name "Sterek".

Much like with Merlin, the pair start the series off on a bad paw. But over the course of a few seasons, end up in a scenario that, if they were a man and a woman, would undoubtedly end in a relationship.<wbr off /> But because they're *two guys*...

And this is not an accident. Even the action is pointing toward romance, whether it's obvious or not. <wbr on />Take this scene, where they're both paralyzed (a-again). Stiles files on top of Derek the same way that we've seen women fall on top of men in a hundred romantic comedies. The way they lock eyes, time and time again.

<wbr on />There are plenty of out queer characters on Teen Wolf, but none of them are leads. The Sterek fandom became rabid online with art and fan fiction, becoming just as popular as the show itself. Some of the cast encouraged the shipping, including Dylan O'Brien and Tyler Hoechlin, *who would cuddle with each other at fan events*.<wbr off /> They baited Sterek as a couple, they baited Stiles's sexuality, with absolutely *no* intention on following through. 

The reason this is so onerous is because the queer baiting didn't even stay in the show! They moved it over into real life. Stiles wasn't just coded adorably bisexual, they used *queer baiting* to get you to *do something* for them!

Arguably, the three biggest media franchises in the world right now are Star Wars, Frozen, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They all have a few things in common: they're all owned by Disney and they've all been accused of queer baiting. Disney is actually kind of terrible for this. Not only do they queerbait their characters, they actually create queer media... and then *yank it away* from you! 

*Love, Victor* was a sequel TV series to the hit film *Love, Simon*. It was announced alongside Disney Plus as one of the big reasons to buy into the service. But then when the show actually *had gay content*, Disney shafted it over to Hulu. Which is not available in nearly as many places as Disney Plus, essentially segregating a gay show that they had promised their viewers. Putting it on a service with a fraction of the subscribers. That way when the ratings aren't that great, they can just say it wasn't popular, and let it die. Maybe even use it as an example as to why queer content doesn't sell! Like I said in my [Stonewall Film Effect video](4YWslnyUxcs.md), as far as executives are concerned, a queer movie or show or book that fails *always* fails because it's queer, never because of the circumstances around it.

Okay. Rant over. Frozen!

## Frozen
{% assign timecode = "1:10:57" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

There's not a whole lot to show about Frozen because most of the queer coding is in song. And Disney will come down on me with the Intellectual Property Hammer<sup>TM</sup> if I play a song from Frozen. But the first film was read as *super queer* by a sizable portion of the population. So much so that homophobic bloggers accused Disney of "indoctrinating children" with the gay agenda. (But they wouldn't have anything to *write* about if children *weren't* being indoctrinated in the gay agenda, so let's ignore them!)

But actual LGBTQ fans of the film latched on to Elsa being the first potentially queer Disney princess, creating the Evergreen social media trend #GiveElsaAGirlfriend. "Let It Go" became a sort of a gay anthem, and the film featured queer icon Idina Menzel in the lead and gay heart throb and (my future husband) Jonathan Groff voicing Kristoff. So fans were hoping for *a lot* when *Frozen 2* finally hit theaters this past year. While the film didn't state Elsa's sexuality one way or another, it left the door *open*, *hinting* at a gay relationship between her and Honeymaren. And the new song "Show Yourself", while not a cultural phenomenon like "Let It Go", became a gay anthem. I mean, with these lyrics how could it not?

So though it wasn't obvious, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega were certainly playing it that way. So would it be more obvious in *The Last Jedi*? Well, leading up to the release of *The Last Jedi*, *Star Wars* producer Kathleen Kennedy was asked about the potential relationship. She said:

\[Quote scrolling on screen like a Star Wars opening text crawl]:
> We've talked about it, but I think you're not going to see that in The Last Jedi. In the next six or eight months we will have some meetings about the stories that we will develop next... After 40 years of adventures, people have a lot of information and a lot of theories about the path these stories can take, and sometimes those theories that come up are new ideas for us to listen to, read and pay attention to.

So not *The Last Jedi*, okay. Running out of time here guys. How about *Rise Of Skywalker*? Well, JJ Abrams teased for months before the film's release that there *would* be *real* LGBT representation in the film. A gay kiss, even. *Obviously* fans thought it would be Poe and Finn. But no, instead, Abrams made sure to give Poe a female love interest, neuter Finn entirely, <span class="visual">and tossed in an out-of-focus, blink-and-you'll-miss-it lesbian kiss between two ascended extras.</span>

After the release of *Rise Of Skywalker*, Oscar Isaac had "this" to say in an interview:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.starwars_interview %}>

Oscar: "It's like, there was an absolute natural chemistry with him. uh, I-I *immediately* felt very connected to him. I remember, uh, it was an audition and the two of us just like did that first scene back-to-back, butt-to-butt, you know, just like doing the scene together practicing it in this room, and like it was just like immediately, all you know all kind of artifice, everything just collapsed, and there was like an intimacy that was very just like there. And um and I think the fact that neither of us shied away from that while we were shooting as well... I think it just was like these are two guys that you know are... he's happy being intimate with each other emotionally, and that um...

Oscar: "So it wasn't actually a total shock that, you know, you know, people, you know, wanted to, you know-- s-saw that in there. Personally, I-I kind of hoped and wished that maybe that would have been taken further uh, in the other films but... you know I don't have control over that..."

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So he wasn't happy about it. The fans shipping FinnPoe weren't happy about it. The gay community wasn't happy about it. And the *Rise Of Skywalker* became the lowest grossing film of the new trilogy. *Star Wars* is now in brand-rehab at Disney, who are trying to figure out what to do with the property after it seemed like no one could agree on *any* of their five *Star Wars* movies that they made to date! With *Solo* bombing at the box office, and *Rise Of Skywalker* coming *nail-bitingly* close to losing money.

I'm not saying making Poe and Finn gay would have saved the box office, probably the opposite, to be honest.

Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, (AKA Chris Evans, because he's the real superhero), and Bucky Burns, AKA The Winter Soldier, are two of the many many many characters in the Disney-owned Marvel Cinematic Universe. They were originally created *way back* in the 1940s, when Bucky was actually Steve's kid sidekick. Because every superhero had to have a kid sidekick.

Fast forward seventy years and about a hundred iterations later, and we see the pairing that become known *the world over* as "Stucky". <span visual=none on="?" off="?">Right from the off, there's a sort of chemistry between them, with Bucky kind of acting as a big brother figure to Steve, who needs help fighting the bullies in his life.

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">One of the things I noticed the first time I saw the movie, which was the first MCU movie I saw, by the way, was that Steve *seemed way* more interested in joining the Army than being with girls. It's easy to read this as him just being *so darn patriotic*, but it was actually extremely common for gay men in the first half of the 20th century to join the military. An all male environment seemed pretty appealing to a lot of gay men at the time. Even if you *did* run the risk of getting shot by a Nazi. But at least you'd die a *hero* instead of people back home finding out that you're a queer, and dying ashamed and alone.</span>

There's also a hint of gay shame.

Was this gay coding in the 1940s? Of course not! It was just a superhero origin story. It may not be allegorical, but it's certainly applicable.

Peggy: "You must have danced."

Steve: "well, asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying. In the past few years, just didn't seem to matter that much. Figured I'd wait."

Peggy: "For what?"

Steve: "Right partner."

(Peggy smiles)

Interesting use of the word "partner", there. Could have said "the right girl". 

<wbr on />So, after Steve becomes Captain America, Bucky is captured and presumed killed by Hydra, the super Nazis, and Steve goes out to save him. Bucky means the world to him, and if there's even a *chance* of him being alive, he's not going to lose him. Cap saves the day, of course, and this tiny gesture...<wbr off /> 

[Showed clip of Cap putting a hand on the back of Bucky's neck for a second.]

I don't know, it really caught my attention the first time I saw the movie.

<wbr on />As they're escaping, the facility begin begins to melt down, but Bucky refuses to leave without Steve. Eventually they both escape, and the dynamic between them changes. Steve is no longer the little guy looking up to his bud Bucky. Bucky is now admiring Steve. Becoming his partner. Fighting the Nazis with him. Until... Bucky falls from a train into a frozen European Wasteland below.

This breaks Steve. The All-American man of men superhero breaks down into tears the loss of Bucky. He's seen so much death in this war, so much carnage, so much loss, but it's the loss of Bucky that breaks him. Then Steve decides to *die* rather than be with Peggy, and crashes a Nazi super plane into a glacier, where he's found a few decades later and resurrected. Because superheroes.

Then in *Winter Soldier*, we find out that Bucky isn't dead. He's been kept alive by Hydra all this time, and is an assassin for them. Again, because superheroes. So while Steve is slowly acclimating to living in the 21st century, the return of Bucky shakes him to his core. A part of his life he thought he'd lost forever is back. 

Steve's already seen Peggy, but she's not the Peggy he knew. She's aged, dying. He still cares for her, of course, but Bucky's the same age as Steve, give or take. He's like a memory, plucked from the past and placed smack dab in Steve's present. Like Steve, he's a part of a world that no longer exists. So even though Bucky has been brainwashed and has the blood of *hundreds* of murdered people on his hands, Steve cannot bring himself to kill him. Not his Bucky. Not in this world of a new millennium, where being LGBT isn't so frowned upon, and maybe he and Bucky could be a real thing.<wbr off /> Peggy even kind of gives Steve permission.

Peggy: "The world has changed. None of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over." (coughing fit)

And Bucky's the only person in this whole wide crazy world that Steve feels he can really connect with. <wbr on />Though Bucky doesn't remember Steve and everyone around him tells him Bucky *needs* to be taken down, Steve refuses. He hopes beyond hope that he can bring Bucky back, not just to save Bucky but to save himself. To be not so alone.

After fighting in a doomed helicarrier, Steve backs off, takes off his helmet, and bears his soul to Bucky, literally dropping his shield, something he hasn't done before. Something that's only *worth it* because it's for Bucky. He does this again in Civil War, literally and metaphorically letting his guard down. For one person, and one person only. When Bucky holds Steve's life in his hand, about to land the killing blow, Steve tells him to do it:

<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.winter_soldier %}>

Steve: "Then finish it. 'Cuz I'm with you to the end of the line."

<james {% include timecode %}>

Steve trusts Bucky, even now in this demented state. He trusts him with his life. And we can see in Bucky's eyes, he's remembering. He's remembering his friend. Looking down into his face, he sees someone he loves. He can't kill him. And when Steve falls from the helicarrier with Bucky left alive, he could just let him fall and drown in the water below. But he saves him. Just like Steve saved him back in World War II. So even after being reprogrammed a hundred times by Hydra, the memory of his love for Steve is so strong,<wbr off /> platonic or romantic, it doesn't matter, their bond is so strong that he overrides *all* of that programming, and saves the most important person in the world to him.

<wbr on />Bucky disappears in into the ether after that, but Steve knows he's alive out there, and he won't give up looking for him. A mission that culminates in *Captain America: Civil War*. In *Civil War*, Steve is willing to let the Avengers fall apart to save Bucky. He's willing to let the might of the *whole world* come down on his shoulders to save Bucky, even after it's revealed that Bucky killed Tony's parents, he still won't let him go, and by abandoning his shield he's even willing to leave the identity of Captain America behind. Because he doesn't need to be Captain America anymore, he doesn't need to be an Avenger, because he's got Bucky.

So Steve and Bucky love each other. Even Joe Russo, the director of *Civil War*, said so! Calling the movie a love story between the two heroes. Now you can say, "James, they're just good friends." 
These arguments often start out under the guise of progressive thought, making claims like "there's so few examples of non-toxic masculinity in media, so we need more portrayals of a positive friendship between two men." This sounds like a good argument at first, until you think about it for a minute or two and remember that *almost all* media is about male relationships and male friendships. When it comes to Captain America, and Bucky Barnes specifically, that well has been tapped quite thoroughly. The relationship between two men who fought alongside each other in a war has been the topic of *many* stories throughout Millennia. It's one of the most popular male friendship stories ever.

And why shouldn't that relationship go beyond just a friendship? Does it ruin the value of the friendship if it's also nonplatonic? *The Iliad*'s story of Achilles and Patroclus's relationship should serve as an early counterpoint here. Ideally, people in a relationship with one another would also be friends. If the idea of characters being in a relationship *ruins* that for you, then perhaps you should think about why you feel that way.

And flip the coin for a second, say Bucky's a woman. Watching these movies, seeing this relationship, would you think for even a second that these two people *aren't* going to end up together in the end? Really? But of course, they don't, because fucking Disney. 

And oddly enough the Stucky pairing would probably be the most Disney friendly gay relationship they could have. Because fans of the proposed couple aren't fans because of the expected sex. (Sure, there's plenty of porn online of the two of them, if you're willing to go look for it.) But that's not what draws people to them. It's a bond between them. It's a bond that lasts for decades, travels through time, goes through hell and back, and yet in the end, they're still dedicated to each other. It's a love story.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I don't even think it was done on purpose, to be honest. Unlike *Teen Wolf* and *Sherlock*, I don't think the writers wrote this pairing or the actors played these parts with the intent on baiting gays into <wbr on />loving them. We were going to go see Chris Evans anyway it's just kind of happened.<wbr off /> A natural outgrowth of the chemistry between the two actors, playing two characters that are innately drawn to one another. I think it's a beautiful accident that can be read as either platonic or romantic love. The fact that so many gay people read it as being a queer love story just shows how starved we are for representation in movies. Just like in the days of queer coding, we're willing to dig deep into our favorite media to find any hint of us possibly being represented. Whether those golden nuggets are actually there or not. But we keep looking and looking, someday, hopefully very soon, there will be a gold rush. Even if right now we're only finding fool's gold.

This video has been a long time coming. I originally started working on it about a year ago, and it was called "For the Love of Stucky" and was just a look at the Stucky relationship. To say it's grown a bit as a bit of an understatement. uh, I'm hoping to get another video out, oh, maybe *sooner* than a year from now? Uh, you can check out my patreon if you'd like to help out in the production of these videos, or... just like, share, and subscribe. Nothing gets this channel out there more than that. You can also follow me on Twitter, @je_summerton, or check out my Community page to vote on what video I'll be doing next. So, thank you, *so much* for watching. I hope you enjoyed this beast of a video. uh, I will be back soon with more content, I promise. So until then take care stay safe.
