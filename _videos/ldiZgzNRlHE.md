I have no idea who this is. The logo is a silver diamond, and the only search results from the time this video was published are for Indian and Irish production/marketing companies.

So far, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been broken up into phases: Phase 1 was the creation of the Avengers, Phase 2 has been the aftermath and some further world-building and will culminate with *The Avengers 2: *Age of Ultron**, and Phase 3 will likely end with *The Avengers 3: Infinity*. Yes, I’m calling it now. The third Avengers movie will be subtitled “Infinity,” or at least have the word “infinity” in the title somewhere. Anyway, we’re all pretty sure, or at least I think I am, about how Phase 2 will turn out. *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* will introduce the concept of Ultron, if not the character, which will probably be a S.H.I.E.L.D. initiative since Joss Whedon has stated that Hank Pym will not be the creator of the psychotic android. So, it’s either a S.H.I.E.L.D. program gone horribly wrong, or a creation of Tony’s gone wrong. But I’m not sure that Whedon is going to basically make *Avengers 2* that centered on Tony Stark, so I’m sticking with the S.H.I.E.L.D. theory—for now, anyway. *Guardians of the Galaxy* will then play more toward the introduction of Thanos, that big purple guy from the mid-credits scene of The Avengers. He will also likely find one or two more of the Infinity Gems, which are being called Infinity Stones in the cinematic universe. These stones play a huge part in the Thanos storyline.

Then we have *Age of Ultron*, which aside from having a psychotic killer robot as the main villain (he’s a lot cooler than he sounds, trust me), will also include the characters of Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, also known as the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. There’s been a lot of drama about these two being used by Marvel because they’re technically mutants, and the children of X-Men villain Magneto, so they should be within the X-Men franchise, which is owned by Fox. But that’s a whole other can of worms, and I’m not going to try and explain that here. These two characters have the potential to be very interesting additions, and I have a feeling that the Scarlet Witch is going to play a massive part in the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but more on that later.

If Ultron ends up being a S.H.I.E.L.D. initiative, there will likely be some disruption between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers. Like, a total split between the two groups. The amount of destruction that Ultron can cause will also leave the Avengers in a pretty rough state, with at least one of their founding members being killed. It is Joss Whedon, after all. So, they probably wouldn’t be in the best of shape once Thanos comes knocking in *Avengers 3*. Just two months after *The Avengers 2* comes out, we enter Phase 3 with the introduction of Ant-Man, a character far more interesting than his name may lead you to believe. But there hasn’t been a whole lot of other news about who else will pop up in Phase 3. Well, my first prediction is that Dr. Strange will find his way onto the silver screen, likely with the Scarlet Witch playing a supporting role in his movie. It will introduce magic to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and allow for some character development of the Scarlet Witch away from her overprotective brother. Phase 3 will also likely see another Thor or Captain America movie, but my guess would be Thor, since he sort of deals in the cosmic side of things, which is where Thanos would be coming from.

Phase 3 would also have a heavy focus on those Infinity Stones. My guess is that the colors traditionally used to represent the Infinity Gems in the comics likely won’t be used here, but all six stones will likely be included. Those six represent soul, time, space, mind, mind, reality, and power. If you have all six, you can pretty much do anything you want, which is why Thanos wants them. See, he’s literally in love with the Marvel universe’s version of the Grim Reaper and basically wants to kill the entire universe so that she’ll love him back. He’s got some issues, but, uh, don’t we all? So, by the time *Avengers 3* rolls around, we would have five of the six stones accounted for, except for the reality stone. Thanos comes to Earth, and all hell breaks loose as he tries to find that last stone and the Avengers try to stop him, obviously. 

</james>

<james {% include timecode %}>

But where is the stone? It would be on Earth, obviously, but where is it? Well, I think it’s intrinsically linked with the Scarlet Witch. The Reality Stone gives you the power to alter reality, even if it conflicts with the laws of science, and that basically explains the Scarlet Witch’s powers. So, Thanos would end up causing some serious physical and mental damage to her in the process of getting the stone. Is the stone inside her? Is she simply a conduit for it? Who knows? But I see this type of thing happening. Of course, Thanos would be beaten, with probably even more Avengers being killed off in the process; my guess is that the only original Avengers left alive at the end of the third film will be Captain America and Iron Man.

Now Phase 4 is some tricky territory because we really have no idea where Marvel could go. Throughout Phase 4, we would see the Scarlet Witch trying to deal with the trauma she went through during the Thanos attack and mostly being ignored by her fellow Avengers. Why? They’re very busy fighting a public backlash, the public believing that Thanos would never have come to Earth had the Avengers never drawn his attention. Tony thinks that the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. should become partners once again, making them publicly accountable and essentially turning the Avengers into a government agency, while Captain America wholeheartedly disagrees and believes that the Avengers need their autonomy. He’s seen how corrupt the government can be, and he wants nothing to do with it.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

This major plot thread would run throughout the Phase 4 movies a little bit at a time, and this would also be when the third Captain America movie would take place, which would really highlight the schism between the Captain and Tony. It would also come to a head when the Avengers team is literally split in half and at war with each other. Scarlet Witch suffers a complete mental breakdown from the combo of her already existing stress and the new stress piled on by this war between her friends. The breakdown causes her to inflict harm on both sides of the Avengers civil war, killing some and eventually causing the team to unite against her. They would then voluntarily disband under the reasoning that the Avengers may have possibly caused more harm than good.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Now, this is just my Phase 4 theory. It would draw heavily from three existing Marvel storylines, those being: *Civil War*, *Avengers Disassembled*, with a hint of *House of M* mixed in there, although that could never really be fully fleshed out because the Marvel characters are split up between so many different film studios. But the spirit of that story would be present. In the end, the Scarlet Witch wouldn’t die, but would fade away. No one would know where she is, no one would be able to find her, but she would be alive somewhere. So, what about Phase 5? Well, Phase 5 is so far off in the future that I’d be flying blind to make any kind of predictions for it, but they follow through with the ideas that I’ve outlined in this video, I think it would be great to introduce the Young Avengers, culminating with the *Children’s Crusade* storyline. But who knows? This is probably all just wishful thinking on my part.

So, what do you guys think of these predictions? Do you have any Marvel storylines that you would love to see come to life in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? And if you have any suggestions for future videos, let me know in the comments below
