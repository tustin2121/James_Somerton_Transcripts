As the film industry moved away from suburban perfection, the extensive efforts made by Hollywood to conceal homosexuality in film during the post-war Lavender Scare era began to deteriorate. And then Hollywood came to realize that they were ignoring a large audience. No, not gays.

At the time the lifeblood of Hollywood was relationship dramas, Disney and fleisure, cartoons and biblical epics. However, they ultimately realized that a group of Americans with disposable income but little to spend it on was being excluded: teenagers. Who were *incensed* to fight back against their parents conservative confining outlook on life.

This rebellious nature spawned, arguably, the most famous adolescent dissident film ever made: <mark>*Rebel Without a Cause*.</mark> The film <mark>contained broad allusions to alternative sexual behavior and the alternatives offered by gang ritualism.</mark> 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.celluloid_closet at="p108" %}>

The fear of homosexuality emerged in several films of the late 1950s, notably in the first serious examination of sissyhood, Robert Anderson's *Tea and Sympathy*, which was brought to the screen by Vincente Minnelli in 1956. In other films, the pressure to conform, to hide any secret sensitivity out of fear of the word queer, was a popular subtext. Nicholas Ray's <mark>*Rebel Without a Cause*</mark> (1955) <mark>contained broad hints of alternative sexual behavior and the choices offered in the ritualism of gang members.</mark> In Jack Garfein's *The Strange One* (1957), perverse sexuality supplements the equally ritualistic behavior of cadets in a southern military school. In Joseph L. Mankiewicz' screen version of Tennessee Williams' *Suddenly Last Summer* (1959), homosexuality becomes evil incar&shy;nate, the symbol of a sterile decadence that is punishable by death. In all these films the homoeroticism of the chief characters is destroyed or discredited as being alien to normal life.

<mark num=1>Plato (played by Sal Mineo) is the loneliest and most troubled</mark> <mark num=2>of the three problematic adolescents in the film</mark>, the other two being <mark num=3>James Dean and Natalie Wood</mark>. <mark>Although he is not *accused* of it</mark>, <mark>Plato</mark> was <mark>raised by a domineering housekeeper in the absence of his father</mark>, which at the time was considered fertile breeding ground for homosexuality.

Plato is a multi-faceted character who challenges traditional gender and sexuality norms. He's a sensitive and artistic young man who admires James Dean's Jim and aspires to be like him. Their relationship is not explicitly sexual, but homoerotic tension permeates it. <mark x>Plato's attraction to Jim originates from his need for a masculine role model in his life who can offer him the emotional support that he lacks at home.</mark>

Jim is a troubled teenager who struggles to blend in with his peers and family. Nevertheless Jim's sensitivity and emotional vulnerability contradict his <mark>society's expectations of masculine behavior</mark>. He is also drawn to Plato despite being confined by the street gang culture of the 1950s.

<mark num=2>Of the three troubled teenagers</mark> in *Rebel Without a Cause* (<mark num=3>James Dean, Natalie Wood</mark> and Sal Mineo), it is <mark num=1>Mineo's Plato who is the lonely, tormented sissy</mark>. <mark>Although he is not accused of it</mark>--unlike Tom Lee in *Tea and Sumpathy*, <mark>Plato</mark> is the mama's boy, <mark>brought up by a smothering maid in the absence of his father</mark>. <mark x>In his adoration of James Dean, he seeks a father more than a lover.</mark> But because Dean returns his feelings so blatantly, sparks fly. Dean's rebellious youth in crisis, a tender and courageous figure, is as loving toward Plato as he is toward Natalie Wood, and the three form a family relationship. Dean's Jim Stark is torn between <mark>society's guidelines for masculine behavior</mark> and his own natural feelings of affection for men and women. To act upon them in the case of Plato or any other man was forbidden, of course, even Jim explodes at finding his father (Jim Backus) in an apron.

Stewart Stern, the screenwriter for Rebel, has told how he drew on his own military experience to create parallels between gang behavior and the all-male dynamic that was present in wartime.

Note: The screenwriter's name is ["Stewart Stern"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Stern). But due to the weird kerning in the print book, an OCR reading (and, tbh, a human reader) can and will easily mistake the "rn" for "m".

Additionally, *Rebel Without a Cause* challenges the conventional gender roles of *women* in society as well. Natalie Wood portrays Judy, Jim's girlfriend, who struggles to find her position in a man's world. Judy's relationship with Jim is complicated because they struggle to express their emotions to one another. However Judy's character is also noteworthy because she challenges conventional notions of femininity. She opposes the role of the passive submissive woman in favor of asserting her autonomy and agency.

As we entered the latter half of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, this appeared to be Hollywood's perspective on homosexuality as well. Theoretically gay characters could exist in Hollywood films but only with one of two conclusions: either they straighten themselves out, or they die. And Hollywood was not hesitant to make films expressing this to the audience. Burying your gays in media has existed *for much longer* than Twitter and Tumblr may think.

<mark>*Tea and Sympathy* is a classic example of repression through coercion.</mark> <mark>The play and film have become so emblematic of the "traditional remedy" for homosexuality, securing the love of a decent woman in the nick of time, that people have forgotten that it's actually a tale about a timid heterosexual.</mark> <mark>Robert Anderson, who adapted his own play for the big screen in 1956, employs the classic outsider archetype of the man who marches to the beat of a different drummer, and must endure the ridicule of his peers. In neither the film nor the play as it ever suggested that the sensitive student, Tom Lee</mark>, <mark>might prefer men over women.</mark>

<mark>The issue at hand is the *allegation* of homosexuality</mark>. <mark>Lee's classmates call him "sister boy", because like Jim</mark> from *Rebel Without a Cause*, <mark>he refuses to run with the pack.</mark> <mark>Tom prefers Bach to baseball. And the companionship of his housemaster's wife Laura</mark> <mark>to touch football</mark>. <mark num=10>His male tormentors disregard</mark> the fact that he is <mark num=11>obviously in love with the elder woman</mark> because <mark num=12>he does not fit the stereotypical male role.</mark>

<mark>A classic story of enforced repression is that of *Tea and Sympathy*.</mark> <mark>The play and the film have become so symbolic of the classic cure for homosexuality, the love of a good woman secured in the nick of time, that people forget it is the story of a shy heterosexual.</mark> <mark>Robert Anderson, who adapted his oun play for the screen in 1956, uses the classic outsider image of the man who marches to the sound of a different drummer and must face the scorn of his contemporaries. Never in the film or in the play is it indicated that sensitive student Tom Lee</mark> (John Kerr) <mark>might actually prefer boys to girls.</mark> <mark>The subject here is the accusation of homosexuality</mark>, not the presence of it (at least not in Tom Lee). <mark>Lee's classmates call him "Sister Boy" because, like Jim</mark> Stark, <mark>he refuses to run with the pack.</mark> And Anderson, like Stewart Stem, was saying. "Look! This too is a man." <mark>Tom Lee likes Bach more than baseball and prefers the company of his housemaster's wife Laura</mark> (Deborah Kerr) <mark>to touch football</mark> with the guys on the beach.

<mark>When Laura ultimately sleeps with Tom, she is not sparing him from a life of sissiness, but rather from his own fear that his classmates may be correct about his sexuality &mdash; a fear that has already led him to *attempt* suicide.</mark>

<mark>When Laura finally sleeps with Tom Lee, she is saving him not from a life of sissyhood but from his own fear that his fellow students might be right about his sexuality- a thought that has already driven him to attempt suicide.</mark> <mark>"To me, it was never a play about homosexuality</mark>," Anderson says. "<mark>When Leif Erickson hounds Tom Lee</mark>, <mark>he's really persecuting what he fears in himself."</mark> Thus *Tea and Sympathy* is the ultimate sissy film; it confirms what the creators and portrayers of sissies have always sought to deny, that the iconography for sissies and for sexual deviates is the same and that the one has come to mean the other.

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

*Tea and Sympathy*, which again <mark>was *not about* homosexuality</mark>, nevertheless <mark>served as a lesson for a generation of gay men who perceived Tom Lee's tormentors' *pointed accusations* not as timid heterosexuals but as horrified homosexuals. The film was able to convey a portion of what actual homosexuals felt and experienced in the 1950s, while staying faithful to the cultural imperative of invisibility. Cultural necessity was, of course, in the hands of The Production Code, and there was never any thought given to making the homosexuality in *Tea And Sympathy* more overt.</mark>

In the film, <mark>even the *prospect* that someone could be gay in reality was eliminated.</mark> <mark>Prior to the commencement to filming, Deborah Kerr wrote to Vincente Minnelli:</mark>

> <mark>"The Breen Office is very difficult about the homosexual angle, which is, I understand, their objection.</mark>

> <mark>Adultery is okay.</mark>

<mark>In fact, adultery was *not* okay, and so it came under attack from the Catholic Legion of Decency anyway. The already altered ending of *Tea And Sympathy* had to be made to reflect the necessary retribution for Laura's affair with Tom</mark>. Thus the finished movie taught that instruction and initiation by an older woman was a positive thing... but that at the same time such behavior could not be condoned. At least not for the woman.

<mark>What emerged in *Suddenly Last Summer* was</mark> a *Glen or Glenda?* <mark>with a budget.</mark> It was <mark>a film with high moral tone that could not, in the end, explore its own subject.</mark> Henry Hart concluded that Suddenly Last Summer "exposes clearly the foremost causes of homosexuality and . . . points to one of the horrible fates that can overtake this particular kind of pervert." In fact the "cause" of Sebastian's homosexuality (no one ever asks what causes heterosexuality because no one is interested in stopping it) is certainly not explored in the film, which is concerned only with the effects of it-which are devastating to all. As for Sebastian's particular fate, it is unlikely that many homosexuals have died at the hands of cannibalistic Spanish-speaking street children. More have died at the hands of "fag bashers" in American cities.

<mark>The erosion of the power of the Production Code to maintain specific taboos had begun at the outset of the 1950s.</mark> Before 1953, no film rejected by the Code had ever had a commercial release. In that year, Otto Preminger's *The Moon Is Blue*, denied a seal of approval because of its light treatment of adultery (which does not actually take place in the film) and its use of the word virgin, was released without the seal and did very well at the box office. In 1956, Preminger again released a film on a controversial subject without a seal of approval. His adaptation of Nelson Algren's *The Man with the Golden Arm* graphically depicted drug addiction, in direct violation of Code precepts, and became highly profitable, earning receipts eleven times greater than its production costs.

<mark num=2>*Advise & Consent*</mark> is a 1962 American <mark num=1>political drama film</mark> <mark>based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel *Advise and Consent* by Allen Drury</mark>, published in 1959.<sup>[2]</sup>

The film was adapted for the screen by Wendell Mayes and was directed by Otto Preminger. The ensemble cast features Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Don Murray, Walter Pidgeon, Peter Lawford, Gene Tierney, Franchot Tone, Lew Ayres, Burgess Meredith, Eddie Hodges, Paul Ford, George Grizzard, Inga Swenson, Betty White and others.

The title derives from the United States Constitution's Article II, Sec. 2, cl. 2, which provides that the president of the United States "shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States."

<mark>The film, set in Washington, D.C., follows the nomination process of a man who commits perjury in confirmation hearings for his nomination as Secretary of State.</mark>

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee appoints a subcommittee, chaired by majority member Brigham Anderson of Utah, to evaluate the nominee. The young and devoted family man is undecided on Leffingwell. Cooley dramatically introduces a surprise witness, Herbert Gelman, during the subcommittee's hearing. The minor Treasury Department clerk testifies that he was briefly affiliated with a communist cell with Leffingwell and two others at the University of Chicago. Leffingwell denies the charge and questions Gelman's credibility but later tells the president that he had committed perjury and that Gelman was correct. He asks the president to withdraw his nomination, but the president refuses.

However, Anderson's personal life is scrutinized when he is coerced by a former male admirer, who threatens to reveal their past relationship... if Anderson does not withdraw his opposition to the nomination. The film's portrayal of homosexuality is nuanced, but it emphasizes the personal and professional dangers gay people confronted in a society that was still primarily antagonistic toward them at the time. Senator Anderson is portrayed as a sympathetic figure who struggles with the contradictions between his private and public lives. He is conflicted between his responsibility as a senator to safeguard the nation, and his desire to live an authentic existence as a gay man. The film illustrates how his sexual orientation could be used against him, not only by political adversaries, but also by those who sought to exploit his vulnerability for personal gain. 

In the end, Anderson's wife receives anonymous phone messages from a man warning that if the subcommittee does not report favorably on the nominee, information about what occurred between Anderson and Rey in Hawaii will be made public. An anxious Anderson travels to New York to meet a fellow army veteran named Ray Shaff. Shaff confesses to selling evidence of a previous gay relationship between the two, leading... to Anderson's suicide.

The film *Victim* was released the same year. Melville Farr, played by Dirk Bogard, appears to be a successful London attorney in a loving marriage, but he conceals his sexual orientation from everyone. When his ex-lover Barrett contacts him for assistance in paying off some blackmailers, he disregards his requests. Barrett has stolen money from his employers and has been apprehended by law enforcement. Knowing that his sexual orientation would soon be revealed... he commits suicide in his jail cell.

Farr, now plagued with remorse, resolves to take on the blackmailing organization, but each of the victims he approaches refuses to assist, preferring to pay the money to keep their private lives hidden. Knowing that Dirk Bogart himself lived his life as a closeted gay man makes *Victim* all the more poignant from a retrospective standpoint. Those who were familiar with the industry at the time claimed that his refusal to enter into a marriage of convenience hindered his prospects at a successful career in Hollywood.

Hollywood continued to produce similar works throughout the 1960s and beyond. Despite widespread criticism of these and other films that perpetuated the Bury Your Gays trope, numerous LGBTQ+ activists and advocates viewed the trend as evidence of a hostile broader cultural and political climate towards the community as a whole. They argue that the trope contributed to a culture of dread and shame surrounding queer identities and reinforced detrimental stereotypes of queer individuals as ill, immoral, and dangerous. The practice however persisted *well* into the New Millennium. 

But there was a faint glimmer of hope on the horizon.

As the 60s came to a close with the Stonewall uprisings, ultimately bringing the lives of gay people to the attention of the general public, and then the gay inclusive x-rated *Midnight Cowboy* won the Oscar for Best Picture, the norms surrounding the depiction of gay characters in film began to disintegrate. Gay people could now exist in Hollywood. But for how long?

\[James talks in a small box on black.]

As we close out this episode I want to thank all my patrons. It's only because of you that videos like this are possible. YouTube isn't all too friendly when it comes to pushing queer content, let alone historical queer content. In fact, in most cases they try their best to keep it hidden. So our amazing patrons are the reason this channel keeps going. Thank you all... so much. Your support and getting to talk to you on the patreon Discord, it really means the world to me. And if you'd like to become a part of this seriously *amazing* community, you can do so for as little as a dollar a month at the link in the pinned comment. All right, now I'll let the credits roll and I'll see you next month for Unrequited Episode Five: A Crack In The Closet.
