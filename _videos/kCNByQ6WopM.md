<u>[James speaking directly into the camera, which is either smudged or overexposed, as things are a little foggy.]</u>

Uh, just a disclosure: this video *is* monetized, but revenue from it will be sent along to HBomberGuy's team to be dispersed to the people whose work I plagarized. Uh, if his team won't accept it, I'll be making monthly donations to Wikipedia and Trans Lifeline going forward. 

Uh, you may have also noticed that a few of my past videos have gone up on the channel again, and revenue from *those*, as well, will also be sent along with the revenue from this video.

Over the last couple of months, I've been getting in touch with the people who I plagiarized... to apologize one-on-one, instead of a mass apology. It's a bit difficult because many of them don't have public email addresses, so I'm still working on it. But it is a *top* priority of mine. 

I've heard back from a few of them, and they were actually incredibly nice. Um, accepting my apology and just *imploring* me to do better in the future. So I want to thank them publicly for that. There's... *plenty* that I haven't heard back from, and I completely understand that. In many cases... uh... I wouldn't want to talk to me either.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tustin %}>

We have sparse evidence of these apologies, and even less of people being nice in return. 

Mick Abrahamson (his work stolen in the [Hogwarts Legacy](jJmN2rC1cVM) video) [mentioned getting an apology](https://twitter.com/DaNanoBiologist/status/1747693696449986675) {% include twitter-mirror link="https://twitter.com/DaNanoBiologist/status/1747693696449986675" %} where he laughed at the idea of James paying him back in 'exposure'. 

David Demchuk (the [Hannibal video](ZDgWHNDdwoU) and not-quite-mentioned in [James's library talk](SMqbxh0zkW0)) mentioned [getting one as well](https://twitter.com/david_demchuk/status/1747729128181092673) {% include twitter-mirror link="https://twitter.com/david_demchuk/status/1747729128181092673" %} but not having the energy to even open it.

Alexander Avila (his videos used in [Unrequited](m8DRQ9-sCSI)) confirmed that [James never reached out to him](https://twitter.com/aretheygay/status/1762301894431490514) to apologize, and that he was still blocked by him. {% include twitter-mirror link="https://twitter.com/aretheygay/status/1762301894431490514" %}

I also want to apologize to my audience, though. You trusted me to be a good representative of the queer community, and I was not that. I *tried* to be. <mark num=1 fc>I tried to be a voice for every member of the queer community</mark>, but that was a... failed endeavor... before it even started. I'm a cis white gay man. No matter *how* much I try to be a good *spokes*person... I can never really truly understand the life experiences of other far more put-upon members of the queer community. <mark num=2 fc>This is one of the reasons that I would use the their own words.</mark> But I should have made it very clear that that's what I was doing. 

<mark num=3 fc>I never... ever... thought that I was the only voice out there</mark>, as some have said, but... being a cis white man, I thought I might be able to win over some people who... wouldn't otherwise listen, unless it was someone who looks and sounds just like them.

<mark num=1></mark>[James conveniently ignores] that multiple people contacted him before these claims came out and he either ignored them or harassed them.

<mark num=2></mark>He says that because of this, he "used their own words." Does not acknowledge that his "use" was literally taking their words and rewriting them to sound like they were his own words.

<mark num=3></mark>James frequently ignored other queer YouTubers and writers unless they were promoting his channel.

And so I tried speaking for everyone. And this was a horrible mistake. What I thought was being inclusive, ended up... leading to a lot of people feeling left out and even offended.

<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

Notice how he's tried to shift this away from being an apology for plagiarism and into something murkier that he can portray as an innocent mistake? And even when he's trying to apologise, he's still rationalising his behaviour and trying to get you to sympathise with him. Guys, seriously, he just wanted to be a good representative of the LGBT community, he just went about it the wrong way!

This fell upon Nick, as well, as a non-binary person on the ace spectrum, they wanted to include asexuality and non-binary representation in our videos. But because Nick's experience is not *universal*... (there is no universal experience...) people felt that we were de-legitimizing their own experiences... *because* we focused on Nick's, and I apologize for that. <mark num=1 fc>And I'm sure that Nick does as well.</mark> 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

He claims a "non-binary person on the ace spectrum" wanted to include asexuality and non-binary representation in the videos but because "Nick's experience is not universal, there is no universal experience" people felt he was de-legitimizing their experiences. Notice that he doesn't say who this person was and just downplays this too "they wanted more representation and hey, we tried, but Nick is just one person, Nick can't possibly represent everyone!" By the way, he’s only doing this part at because he got called out by [The Ace Couple](https://theacecouple.com/episode116/) and he’s uh, pretty clearly rewritten their concerns to come from an anonymous person so you don’t go looking them up.

[Also,] First instance of directly blaming Nick for something he did.

Um, I'd also like to extend a personal apology to Jessie Earl, better known as Jessie Gender. Out of everyone that I spoke to who was... also a YouTuber, Jessie was by far the kindest person&mdash; I think Jessie might be one of the kindest people I've ever met&mdash; or ever encountered; we never actually met in person. Because of my hot headedness, I... drew her into just this... anger spiral of mine that was... unwarranted and... absolutely ruined a possible friendship. 

Jessie was actually doing her best to kind of... mitigate my frustration an-and everything, a-and uh... at that moment, and... I just... wasn't allowing her to do that, and I really truly honestly want to apologize to her for that. Again, if you ever get the chance to speak with Jessie one-on-one, or if you have gotten the chance, you'll know just how nice she is, and how kind, and... I was a... a real asshole... for, uh... dragging her into my... reactionary... unwarranted frustration. We&mdash; obviously, we haven't spoke since all of that happened, um, but Jessie if you are *watching* this video, um... I do want you to know that I am honestly sorry.. for that. I hope... truly, honestly, I hope everything... goes as well as possible for you, because you deserve all of it.

There was a misunderstanding between Jessie and I, um, *after* that happened that I do want to clear up. Where someone who at least claimed to be a fan of Jessie's... you know, <mark num=1 fc>did an internet and threatened to kill me</mark>, which is... you know, being a person on the internet, death threats are unfortunately not uncommon. At the time though, uh... I was in a very panicked state and so I did report it to the police. I did not report Jessie to the police, which is the misunderstanding that people, um... came away with. I did not report Jessie to the police. I would have no reason to do that. And it did end up that this person had a prior record with the police, um, of violent acts. <mark num=2 fc>And they actually lived quite near me. Um, so the police took it very seriously.</mark> They took it *so* seriously that they implored me not to... speak to Jessie, which I took their... advice on, which I *shouldn't* have, honestly. I should have *at least* clarified to Jessie what was going on, and not just left her hanging. And so, I want to again apologize to Jessie for that. But in that state, I listen to the police, which is... you know, maybe not the best decision all the time, because the cops don't usually have the best interests of people at heart, so...

Jessie, I want to apologize for that and everything else that happened. Completely understand why you would not want to speak to me *ever* again, but I just want you to know that I am sorry. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tustin %}>

Jessie made [a lengthy video on her second channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aKlt9-XZik) discussing the fact that he apologized directly to her. (She says that she wouldn't be making this video if he hadn't directly mentioned her, as she's trying to just move on from this.) 

She says that they had a cordial professional relationship, as she tries to do for a lot of creators on YouTube to help them grow. She also attempted to help him get on Nebula by getting him an invite to a Discord server where other Nebula folks were, so he could network with them (which he never did). 

She also goes into James basically defaming Nebula for "not having any queer / black creators", which it definitely did, and how she responded to that. And how James went onto a live stream and complained after that. And then how it escalated to James claiming that Jessie's followers sent him false SA allegations and death threats and him involving the police.

Jessie says before she can accept the apology, she would like to see the police report he claims he filed, just as proof that he's not lying and that his word can be trusted.

<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>1st instance of James seeking sympathy via phantom death threats.

<mark num=2></mark>I'd like to also add that when James returned to Instagram he made a claim that people who watched HBomb's video <a href="{{ "/media/receipts/james-insta-break-in.webp" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">had tried to break into his building</a>. It got him some sympathy there and on Reddit so it seems he's learned from that and added this detail into his new narrative about what he did to Jessie Earl. Again, he cares more about being seen as a victim here.

But now back on the original topic: the work Nick and I were doing on the channel, we wanted it to be... you know, for *everyone*. We wanted it to be a channel where every queer person could feel welcomed... And we failed at that. That is something that, in *hindsight*, I think is impossible to create. And that's why it's important for there to be many different queer voices *in* spaces like YouTube, and there are. What's more important is that those voices are discoverable, which is something that I should have been helping with. 

<mark num=1 fc>I often shared other queer creators on *Twitter*, but... this was when I only had, you know, eight-hundred, a thousand, Twitter followers, and these creators usually had *a whole* lot more than that. It was a weird... *thing*, because *usually* they would have infinitely more *Twitter* followers, but a whole lot less YouTube subscribers.</mark> I'm not sure what created that dichotomy, but something was definitely off with the algorithm there. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>For just one example, [the Ace Couple podcast](https://theacecouple.com/episode116/) pointed out a livestream they were in where James had multiple ace creators pointed out to him and declined to promote them or acknowledge them. Also he never once shared the content of the people he plagiarised. Because remember, this is supposed to be an apology for his plagiarism.

There is a part of my brain that says YouTube kind of went "oh, you know, white male queer! Let's push him!" and... you know, ignore everyone else in the community, whereas people were able to actually discover, uh... other queer creators on Twitter, and then make their way to YouTube. But the YouTube algorithm, kind of... that's the most negative interpretation I have of it, which unfortunately may be true.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

Now he blames the *YouTube algorithm* for pushing his channel and not others. But we already know that James was actively taking advantage of the algorithm by spamming regular content to the extent that the algorithm would push his videos instead of the videos of the people he was stealing from who took longer to make content because they actually did *work.* But James just claims YouTube must have gone "oh white male queer, let's push him and ignore everyone else!" Do you like how James just made being a cis white guy into a cross he must bear? Again?

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Uh, in any case, I *should have done more* to share the voices of other queer people. Certainly the people whose works I *used*, both <mark num=1 fc>credited</mark> and plagiarized... in my videos. But also just other creators on YouTube. It's important for us as a *community*, as vaguely defined as we are, to support each other. And... I didn't do that nearly enough.

From day one, I was *very* taken in by the idea of being a YouTuber. As soon as my videos started to get recommended by the algorithm, after not releasing a new video for like two years, I... felt like I had a short period of time to get the next videos out, as soon as possible... which is why so little work was put into the writing of them. And so much was taken from other places&mdash; plagiarized.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>He snuck in a reference to "credits" again. His regular defense in the past and [in his first video](VToXKOOK4mw) and in the emails to other creators has always been to say this was a matter of "credits" and not that James took their writing word for word and read them as if they were his own.

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Early on, I thought <mark num=1 fc>crediting authors in the opening credits *alone* was *enough*</mark>. <mark num=2 fc>Especially since the videos weren't monetized early on.</mark> But I understand now, especially after speaking with some of the people who were&mdash; who I did plagiarize, that that was just... I was wrong. That was not the way to go about it. They should have been cited properly within the text of the video. They should have been called out in the video at least once, verbally, as well as, you know, having citations *on screen*. If there were a whole lot of them, like, with &mdash; you know, one of the examples that HBomberGuy used in his video was the Deep Cuts video &mdash; <mark num=3 fc>there were a *whole* lot of people who I, you know... credited in the opening credits, but really, it's... plagiarism. They should have been cited... on-screen</mark> with *actual* citations of, you know, *links*, where you can find this stuff. Maybe there should have even been a bibliography that you could have gone to like on a Google drive or something like that. Because, you know, although I might have stated that the scripts were based upon the work of these authors, it in many cases wasn't just *based* on their work, it was their work, word-for-word. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>There are multiple documented instances of James not crediting the people whose work he stole, or only doing so when the authors discovered his plagiarism and called him out. Much of this was covered in [the HBomb video]({{ hbomb.url }}). <u>[Much more still is covered on [the rest of this site]({{ "/" | relative_url }}). {% include signed for=tustin %}]</u>

For about a minute he continues his pivot away from admitting he plagiarised and gets back to simply saying "I should have credited them at least once verbally," but like... James didn't just use their work. He rewrote essays by other creators about their personal experiences to remove pronouns that indicated it wasn't his. He rewrote sentences to carefully alter their terminology to something he thought was more pleasing to his audience. At more than one point he accidentally cited creators simply because the work he plagiarised was citing them too. And that's before we even get into him being caught lifting the footage and commentary whole cloth from [Alexander Avila's "Are They Gay" videos](m8DRQ9-sCSI).

<mark num=2></mark>Also [he] claims the videos weren't monetized early on. We can't really verify that, but I call BS again because... why else would he churn out that much content to game the algorithm? He also already had a Patreon by then.

<mark num=3></mark>I'm just gonna point out that he just... pauses several times in this sentence. You can see him thinking about the best way to phrase his excuse, when he stutters on "who I.... you know.... credited". Then half-heartedly says "but really it's plagiarism", and then goes right back to "they should have been cited on screen". He's trying to intentionally blur the line between "crediting" and "plagiarism" over and over so you will start thinking of plagiarism as simply a mistake of attribution and not what James actually did. He wants to have this video both ways - he wants you to think he's acknowledged the plagiarism by saying "plagiarism" but then always shifts to how he should have done better "citations", which is the excuse he's been workshopping to other creators he's contacted.

I sent the finished video to him, and he watched it and he gave me permission. But... in most cases, I didn't get permission, and thought that just putting the author's name in the opening credits was enough. I was much more interested in the *production* of the videos than the writing of them at this point. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

[He] then tells the long debunked lie that he got permission from Sean Griffin for his "Evil Queens" video that was lifted wholesale from "Tinkerbelles and Evil Queens". Confirms to me he didn't watch the Hbomb video because Harry deep dived into this specifically since James has workshopped how to present this one for two years now.

In the screenshot, Griffin clearly saw the video much later and James only contacted him after the plagiarism was called out, after James' harassment campaign against a Twitter user, and after the "About Those Death Threats" video. Griffin is otherwise pretty chill, but also isn't actually giving permission here - he's just not stopping him. James was asking for forgiveness instead of permission.

<comment {% include commenter for=tustin %}>

Sean Griffin [wrote a blog post about this whole ordeal](https://www.fromthesquare.org/how-my-book-became-the-subject-of-a-youtube-scandal-by-sean-griffin/). In it, he talks about how he never wanted to get into this drama in the first place and how he was sadly dragged into it against his will anyway. He originally gave James permission after watching the video essay "because I did not think it too huge a deal to get into over a 20 year old book." And he was notified of the HBomerGuy video after his students told him about being in the video. He turned down HBomberGuy's offer to be compensated, as he was not struggling financially. 

(It's clear to me this poor man just wants to be left alone at this point, so please don't contact him over any of this stuff.)

So after three or four videos, I brought Nick on as a main writer for the channel. <mark num=1 fc>The idea is that they would write the vast majority of the scripts...</mark> I would film, voice, and edit the videos, and we'd split the money that came in. 

We were roommates at the time, and Nick didn't have a job, so I figured it would help both of us. This is actually when we had some of our biggest videos. Uh, like the ones talking about [Wiccan and Hulkling](SHFUAlDFdYY), where <mark num=2 fc>we lucked out because it came out right in time for *WandaVision* to hit</mark>. And then the [*Killing Stalking* video](ujmgqNyZ190), which became our... biggest video by far. Uh, the [Sadism of Class](xsrV2LXP0bY) was another one. These videos *weren't* plagiarized, and we loved making them.

<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>Whether he's going to admit this or not, this is still implying that the rest of the plagiarism was Nick.

<mark num=2></mark>I... do not buy that the Wiccan and Hulking video was "lucky" to arrive in time for the premiere of Wandavision. He was algorithm farming again. YouTube, why are you making him do this?!

James claims there's no plagiarism in the videos he mentions (and which I have linked to our transcript pages). Feel free to click through and see just how wrong he is about them not having any plagiarism.

Uh... it didn't take long for the channel income to start growing. Lucky timing, really, because this was around the same time that I was laid off since the company that I was working for downsized once Covid hit its second year. Nick and I had both grown up poor. So we started doing what we could to try and stabilize our income as much as possible. This meant putting out *more* videos, which meant I had to take over more of the *writing* duties, but since filming, editing &mdash; usually doing... multiple edits because of YouTube copyright issues &mdash; as well as managing the channel... *and* dealing with my mom's recent cancer diagnosis. All of that was already taking up so much of my time and attention. 

This led to a lot of... copy and pasting... blocks of text into scripts. <mark num=1 fc>My *intention*, at the time, was to use these as a jumping off point once Nick and I sat down to edit the script</mark>, because that's what we would do: I would sort of put in my parts, Nick would put in his parts, and then we would sit down at a table, read through the whole script, and kind of try and make it seem cohesive. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>This is literally the excuse Fillip Miucin used when he was caught plagiarism other people's reviews. Also implicates Nick again by saying Nick was included in these discussions.

But &mdash; and <mark num=1 fc>here's something... I'm sure a lot of people will call a bullshit excuse &mdash; I have memory issues... because of a head injury from when I was a child.</mark> Uh, they're actually getting worse. I've talked about it on streams and in videos, so yes, it *is* real, but... some people will call it a excuse anyway.

The head injury is actually what led to me having epilepsy, which is why I can't work in any job that involves physical labor. Employers can't get insurance for me to, like, lift things or operate vehicles and stuff like that. I actually did marketing for a restaurant group for a little while, but got let go when they found out that I was epileptic because, at least according to *them*, <mark num=2 fc>I couldn't be insured to be in the kitchens...</mark> where I needed to be to film videos and take photos and stuff like that. But anyway.

<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>He claims he's talked about this before but he knows "some people" will call bullshit anyway. Well, yea, James, we're calling bullshit but not because you didn't talk about your head injury enough.

<mark num=1></mark>James has never mentioned epilepsy in a main-channel video before, and most people on the former fans discord could not remember him discussing it before.

When it came to editing the scripts, I couldn't remember what I'd written and what had been copy-pasted. We should have just chucked out *everything* that I had put into the script and filled them in with *wholly* original thoughts. Or I should have been taking notes on where things came from so that we could at least cite them in the video, if nothing else. But I never did that.

According to my... therapist, my not thinking to do that <mark num=1 fc>probably stems from my recently diagnosed ADHD</mark>, but I don't know if I'm willing to... *say* that really. Maybe it was? Or maybe it was just plain laziness. Maybe I thought that this was somewhere that I could cut a corner because I was torn in so many other directions. Honestly, I can't remember &mdash; like I said, memory issues. But, yes, we should have just thrown out my contributions to the scripts and filled them in with original writing... <mark num=2 fc>but we felt like we had too much of a time crunch. We felt like we had to get videos out more often to feed the algorithm.</mark> 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>...and [he] blames the lack of note taking on his recently diagnosed ADHD. Bruh. I have ADHD. I've had it all my life and we're like the same age. I also know that I can't use my ADHD as a "get out of being a dick free" card.

<mark num=2></mark>Now he's also blaming the relentless release schedule for why he didn't toss out "the text I wrote." Remember, the text he "wrote" is what he just said is text he stole. And like, again, he was the one who decided getting videos out fast to get the algorithm on his side was more important than doing research or actually watching or reading the media he's claiming to be an expert on or I dunno writing his own opinions. The plagiarism was a shortcut. He knows that. We know that. But we're still watching him fall back into old patterns.

And then my mom died... and I became completely useless. I couldn't think straight, at all, so Nick had to *completely* take over writing duties, while *I* dealt with things you deal with after a person dies. My dad, you see, he can't read or write, uh... he was *very* poor when he was a kid, so he had to leave school really young to work in order to feed his *many* brothers and sisters. So I had to deal with all the legal stuff after my mom died, as well as making sure that all my dad's bills were paid and whatnot. Especially after his income was basically cut in half.

3rd time Nick is thrown under the bus. Also blames his dad's illiteracy and then diverts to a tangent about how his dad was also poor growing up. Remember that every tangent is meant as a distraction.

There was supposed to be a buffer here, money-wise, as my mom had a life insurance policy that was going to be split between my dad and myself. But the insurance company (RBC Insurance so if you have insurance with them, maybe rethink that) uh, refuse to pay out the policy because my mother never mentioned that she had family with diabetes. *She* didn't have diabetes, but because she didn't think to mention that she had family with diabetes, it apparently voided the policy. All they did was refund a year's worth of premiums that she'd paid even, though she'd been paying them for about 15 years...

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

One of the things &mdash; the main thing, really &mdash; that I was supposed to do with my portion of the insurance money was I was supposed to make a movie. These were direct instructions from my mom, herself. She'd been *very much* behind me when I decided&mdash; when I was about 10, that I wanted to be a filmmaker. And she wanted me to finally have the opportunity to do that, even if she never got to see it. So when the life insurance... went bust... I decided to try and crowdfund it. At least enough to make a short film or two.This is what... Telos grew out of.

When we launched the campaign in February of 2022, we hoped to raise $3,000 to produce a short film that we hoped that we would then use as a sort of proof of concept to attract investors, either private, public, or through Canada's telefilm program, to produce a feature. Some people online have stated that $3,000 *never* would have covered the cost of a short film, <mark fc=false>but these were not going to be unionized movies, and we were very clear about that upfront. We wanted to be able to pay actors as best that we *could*, but we never expected to be able to reach typical union wages.</mark> 

The crew was going to be made up of people that I had gone to film school with. Everyone (including Nick and myself; we were roommates at the time, living on the East Coast) were more than happy to work behind the scenes for free. We planned on writing a movie with a small cast and only one or two locations, ideally ones that we could get access to for free. Again, we assumed all the money would go to the actors. Uh, we kind of looked at this is a sort of Community Theater troop, but for filmmaking.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=lvence %}>

Wait James is a liar. On the Telos [Discord's] update channel <a href="{{ "/media/receipts/telos_update.png" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">he wrote this</a>:

> We're making some real progress on the first Telos Pictures movie, which I'm excited to talk about but can't divulge too much yet. But I wanted to put out a statement about actor pay, since it's become a very clear that major studios and streamers look at actors like subhumans.
> 
> Everyone hired to be in our first feature will be paid union scale for the production size (ACTRA is the Canadian actors union), but will also receive profit participation. And unlike major studios, Telos will be VERY happy to let everyone know when the movie becomes profitable.
>
> 50% of any sale or rental will go back into Telos's production fund, but the other 50% will be shared with everyone who helps get the movie made. If the film is sold to a distributor, they'll receive a percentage of the sale as a lump sum." 

But in the apology he claim that the movie was just going to be his film school buddies and he will not pay them union wage 🤨

</comment>
<comment {% include commenter for=tustin %}>

Additionally, on the Telos Indegogo page, [one of the updates mentions](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/telos-pictures#/updates/10):

> And we've discovered a program within ACTRA (Canada's version of the Screen Actors Guild) that will actually allow us to hire unionized actors! There's about six mountains worth of paperwork required to do it but, hey, if you want something you've got to work for it.

So "very clear about that upfront" is a blatant lie.

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

After the campaign launched, it did *infinitely* better than we could have expected and our ambitions grew. We started planning to make a feature instead of a short film. And the plan was to take this around t0, uh, film festivals. The feature we settled on, entitled "Final Girl", was about the lone survivor of a slasher movie-type massacre 10 years after the fact, as she was publishing a book about her ordeal, drawing attention from people online convinced that *she* had actually been the killer all along. In the end, we would find out that the killer was the *boyfriend* of the girl who the main character had secretly been dating at the time of the killings. And most of the people he killed were, in his eyes, collateral damage as he made his way to our main character. Because he was not happy that his girlfriend was cheating on him with a girl.

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And to those who say that I plagiarized the plot from the novel *Final Girl Support Group* by Grady Hendrix, read the book. It's nothing like the plot of the movie. And the final girl is a trope in horror movies. So if using the Final Girl trope is plagiarism, then basically everyone who's made a slasher movie since *Texas Chainsaw Massacre* owes the Toby Hooper Estates some money. But anyway.

Nick and I planned out the movie, but I didn't want to start *writing it* until the campaign ended and the money was actually deposited. Uh, after the insurance debacle, I didn't want to count our chickens before they hatched. When the money was officially deposited, I immediately began work on the screenplay. I finished it that summer, soon after Nick had left to spend two months at home in Ottawa, Ontario with family. I sent the script to him to read right away, because I was proud&mdash; very proud of it. But Nick didn't want to share his opinion on it until he got back to the east coast. So in the *meantime*, I put out a preliminary casting call on local job boards. 

</james>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

When Nick got back, uh, he... believed that the script needed a page one rework. This is also when he told me that he'd be moving back to Ontario permanently soon, as he wanted to live closer to family and live in a bigger city with more opportunities. This was a punch to the gut for me. We'd been living together since 2015 and had become quite dependent on each other. I felt like there was no way that I could make this movie without him. And since I had received... not that many replies to the initial casting call, I took this as a sign that *Ontario* would be a better place to launch Telos. Even though all my profisional&mdash; professional film connections were on the East Coast. 

That was a mistake. There I had free access to the campground that would serve as the setting for a good portion of the movie, as well as easy access to any number of houses apartments and even offices that friends of friends would let me use to shoot. In Ontario, I had none of that. Which immediately put the breaks on *Final Girl* since there was no conceivable way of filming it, at least not within the budget that we had. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

Look this is a really long tangent that doesn't mean much. It includes his 4th bus tossing of Nick where he keeps lightly blaming Nick wanting to move back home to be closer to family for why James wasn't able to make Final Girl. First it's Nick holding up script approval, then it's Nick saying the script sucked, then it's Nick wanted to move to Toronto and James discovered when he moved to Toronto that he couldn't possibly make the movie there on "their budget". FYI, Toronto is one of the two major English speaking hubs for Canadian film, television, and theatre. The tangent continues that this is when he started making the posters for other "potential projects" to "show his progress." Does not address the radio silence all of his backers got.

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

After Nick and I moved to the Toronto area, he decided that he actually wanted to move home to Ottawa... uh, to the Ottawa area, about 5 hours away. At least for a little while. In the meantime he would take a train to the GTA (the Greater Toronto Area) once a month... uh, to work on YouTube videos for a few days and then head back. 

This went on for... <u>[Doing mental math]</u> ...a little less than a year. So, I began brainstorming new movies that we could film in Ontario. This is where the multiple posters and teaser trailers came from. I was trying to create something *tangible* to show that work was still being done with Telos. I wrote multiple treatments for movies over the next few months. And Nick and I eventually landed on one called "Antisocial", a murder mystery about a former social media clique, who had gone their separate ways on very bad terms and they were coming together for a reunion at a sort of VidCon event. Um, they were all sharing a house and then some of them were going to start showing up dead.

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Around the same time, summer of 2023, uh, Nick had moved to the GTA full-time. Uh, he and I spent *weeks* working out exactly how the murder mystery would parse out in the movie. We had a bunch of whiteboards up on my wall and we were just breaking it down piece by piece. Uh, I'd put out a new casting call in the GTA and received *hundreds* of responses. So, I was planning on casting as soon as the script was finished. But after trying to work out the numbers as far as paying actors went, plus locations, food, costumes, as well as the equipment that we'd already purchased, and the legal costs of setting up Telos as a business, we realized that we'd gone way too big with this movie. 

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Uh, the movie had too many characters and too many locations... and it was just way too complex to be able to pull off... with the budget. So I started working on a script for a movie called "The Listener", about a true crime podcaster focused on the mysterious deaths of homeless gay men in his city. I was a fair way into the script when we realized... it'd be about a year... before we could even film anything. Since winter was on its way and the story relied heavily on a summer setting. 

</james>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So we went back to the drawing board yet again, finally settling on a modern-day adaptation of *The Vampyre*, based on the book by John Polidori. Uh, it's one of the original works of published vampire fiction. It's never received a *proper* film adaptation, and was in public domain, so we thought it would be a great choice. And the cast could be kept down to basically five characters, with only two of them being on screen most of the time. Nick and I both wrote treatments for it, which we plan on&mdash; planned on melding together into a final treatment, that we would write the script based off of.

We'd had a meeting about it, and we were talking about how best to move forward, how fast we could get the script written, how long it would take to cast, how soon we could start shooting. We knew that it had been a while since the initial funding of Telos came in, and we wanted to get something concrete out as soon as possible. After the meeting, we went to dinner... and while *at* dinner, I started getting messages about the HBomberGuy video.

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We were in over our heads once we left the East Coast. But the intention was never *ever* to take the money and run. I was so insanely excited about getting to make Telos a reality. I was excited about getting to make a *short* film, let alone a feature. It's always been my dream to make movies. So Telos meant... and *means*... the world to me.

<mark num=21 fc>For Nick, it was a very exciting project, but not his passion.</mark> Nick wanted to write novels, he still does. Nick looked at this as a good creative outlet that was way more fulfilling than writing video essays. I should have stayed where I was, and not gone to Ontario. The move uprooted... *everything* that was solid about Telos, and it took a whole year to get it back onto even anything close to stable footing.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

<mark num=1></mark>5th bus toss on Nick, he claims making movies just wasn't Nick's *passion*. Also suggests Nick didn't even want to write videos? I mean I guess that explains why Nick claimed they were lazy about research.

<james {% include timecode %}>

But I am working with the producer now. So you can expect an *actual product* from Telos this year. It will likely be a short film, to start off. But there is going to be something coming out of Telos this year.

I know I've lost your trust. But I will make nothing financially from this project. The money that is there will go *wholly* to paying queer artists to work on a queer film. I am not, nor have I *ever intended to be*, one of the people paid by Telos. Neither was Nick; we made this very clear to everyone who asked. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

Finally, says something about the money!

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

During our work on Telos is also when the YouTube channel started getting sponsors. Which, as I said, as someone who grew up poor, I basically accepted all of them. Except for a few that I didn't think lined up with the message of the channel or had some... bad... news surrounding them. There were a couple that had some anti-trans stuff going on in the news and I just didn't want to associate with that. But by accepting as many sponsors as we *did*, which became very important when Nick and I started living apart and suddenly had *two* rents to pay, we ended up needing to produce even more videos. Which along with the work on Telos, and making sure everything was okay with my dad while living thousands of kilometers away... meant I had even *less* time for writing. Putting more stress on Nick and leading to even more copy-pasting from me. That's what led to us putting out... I think *six* videos in one month at one point? It might have been five. But in any case it was *way* too damn many videos to go out in one month.

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We tried to take the summer off from YouTube in 2023 to work on Telos exclusively, but even that went up in smoke because my housing situation... just... I won't go into it here. I've talked about it ad nauseum on streams and stuff. If you followed me on social media, you know the cluster I ended up in... that led to me moving twice in two months. 

In the last couple of months, I've received a lot of emails, as you can imagine. Uh... many from people who were rightfully let down. Some from people threatening everything from doxing to violence, because the internet. Some with the kindest words of support I've ever heard, and others simply asking why I made it so difficult to contact me and if I was okay. They wanted to know why, as they put it, I "nuked" my social media presence.

...To be frank... it's because I didn't want to exist anymore. If you watched my... honestly... *horrendous*... apology video back in December... you know I tried to make that happen. The not existing thing. But it was more intense than... taking too many pills. It's not that I didn't want to be *alive* anymore. It's that I *wished* I'd never existed at all. That everyone I'd ever known would be better off... had I just never been there. Very George Bailey. Which is fitting given that it was Christmas time. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

As someone who's struggled with the same mental illness, I always feel sympathy for anyone going through it. But it is not an excuse to hurt others and it's not a shield from responsibility for things you do when you're 100% lucid. Anyway, James does acknowledge the "horrendous video" in December. So I start to tear up a little from my own PTSD as he describes the emotions that he experienced about not wanting to exist anymore. And then... he says "Very George Bailey, which is ironic because it's Christmas time." I'm just yanked out of it by the weird non-sequitur. If I hadn't experienced some 25 minutes of non-pology and lies before this I'd forgive this but by now James has too deeply poisoned that well.

It's only thanks to some very *very* dedicated doctors and nurses... and one very good friend... that I'm... *even* here able to film this right now. I'm not going to name her, because I don't want to expose anyone else to the *small*, but... *seriously unstable* group of people who watched the "Plagiarism and You(Tube)" video and thought... "well, he should be dead".

Like I said, it's a... it was a very small group. But when they find out your address... and some of them are actually *in your city*... they can be terrifying. And they *did* find my address. And at least a couple of them showed up... while I was at the hospital. Um... my neighbors did report them to the police, uh... and I-I won't go into any more details than that. I'm not sure if I legally, even, *can* but... there's a reason I left Ontario within a week of getting the okay to do so from the doctors.

This is almost word for word the phrasing he used in the "About Those Death Threats" video that caused someone else to receive so much harassment and threats that she wiped her presence online to stop it.

So what's next then? Like I said... you'll notice that a few of my videos are live again on the channel. These ones don't come from plagiarized content. And, for the most part, are written entirely by Nick. Nick lost *three years* worth of work when everything on the channel was taken down. And that's... simply not fair... to Nick. He worked hard writing those videos and deserves to have something to *point* to when he's looking for new writing work.

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've also done some heavy editing on *other* videos that did contain other people's writing, um... breaking it down to only original content, again, so that Nick has an actual portfolio of work. As mentioned at the beginning of the video, revenue from these will be going to the HBomberGuy team to be sent out to the writers I plagiarized from, or donated to charity. However it works out in the end.

These edited videos will be going back up on the channel in the next few days, I think, um, along with two completed video essays that we didn't actually get to release before everything happened. There's also some recent videos that didn't have any plagiarism that the sponsor asked to be taken down, and their ads removed. Um, so they'll also be going back up without the sponsors, obviously. 

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And soon I *will* be releasing a new video... written entirely by me... *properly* cited... with all sources credited. Maybe no one will watch it. But I hope you do.

I want to prove that I have the ability to do this without abusing other people's work. It's a very different kind of video... than I used to make though. I'd say it's more of a documentary than a video essay. You won't find my "opinions" anywhere in there, just cited facts.

I'd like to keep making videos like these new ones, about people and events in gay history. And definitive gay movies, that you maybe never heard of. Stuff like that. It's actually something that I *planned* on doing this year anyway. There would be two videos a month. Nick would write a video essay and I would write one of these documentary-style videos that would fulfill the two videos per month sponsorship deal that we had at the time.

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I have no sponsors now, so... probably not going to be two videos a month. It'll probably just be the one. Which will give more time for research and citation and crediting and making sure that there is no misinformation in the videos. Uh... which I know... I know that misinformation... made its way into, uh, our past videos. That was not... something that we intended. In some cases, it was information that I was told by people that I considered experts, um... In other cases it was information that we had researched, uh... In other cases, it was... things that Nick had learned in university. 

The point being it was never *malicious*. We didn't... we weren't trying to *lie* about things, despite what a lot of people think. We were not trying to spread misinformation. That was not *ever* our intention. And that's something else that I want to apologize for.

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

As for my Patreon. everyone can stop worrying about me relaunching it right in time for a billing cycle. That will not be happening. I don't want anyone who... either doesn't know about the plagiarism or simply forgot to unsubscribe to get billed. So... I'm going to start from zero. I have put together a new patreon account.

So if you want to support my documentaries about gay history... fantastic. Honestly, your faith in me after everything... means *the world* to me. If not, I completely understand. Like I said... I've lost your trust... I'm going to work my ass off to earn it back, though. 

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And I know for some of you, I'll *never* be able to do that, but I'm going to try anyway. You know, there's a link in the description to the patreon if you want to join it, where you'll be able to see the two yet-to-be-released videos right now, as well as, you know... take part in other stuff that will be on there, like a book club, podcasts, uh... voting on upcoming videos, all the usual Patreon stuff. 

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But this video is not about promoting myself. This video is about... me apologizing. And I am incredibly sorry. <u>[sigh]</u> It was never my intention for anyone... to feel hurt, or left out, or excluded. It was never my intention to spread misinformation. And I'm really... really sorry that that happened. And, you know, as as much as I've tried to *explain* myself in this video, you know, the memory issues, the ADHD, um... the personal things that were going on in my life with my mom getting sick and then dying and trying to make sure that my dad was okay following that and everything... those aren't excuses. There is no excuse for what I did. 

There are lots of people who make videos on YouTube. There are lots of people who make podcasts, TV shows, movies, documentaries, who... have... shit going on in their lives that's very stressful. And they don't plagiarize people's work. There is no excuse for what I did. For everything that happened, whether it be... with my mom or the memory issues, there was something I *could have done* to mitigate that. There's nothing I could have done about my mom getting cancer, but... 

</james>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Knowing my patrons as I did, in hindsight, I'm pretty damn sure that if I had said, "guys, I need to step away for a couple of months to deal with this"... I don't think a whole lot of people would have fled the Patreon. A part of me thought they would at the time, because I catastrophize... but I really don't think that would have happened. Even in the very beginning, when I was like, "oh, I got to get as many videos out as possible", if I had said to those people who subscribed to the channel early on, you know, for the next video, I want to make sure that it's fully correct and I want to make sure that, you know, it's as high quality as it can possibly be, I-I don't think anyone would have you know unsubscribed or not watched the next video because it didn't come out a couple of weeks after... the algorithm decided that I was important for some reason. I convinced myself of these things. But I don't think, in hindsight looking at it, I don't think any of that would have happened. And so there is no excuse for the misinformation. And there is certainly no excuse for the plagiarism.

Even if it was, you know, everyon&mdash; even if it wasn't, you know, taking giant chunks of their work... paragraphs at a time, even if it was just a sentence here or there... putting their name in the opening credits doesn't tell *anyone* where their work is in the video. Nobody can say, "oh, I really like that opinion" or "wow that's a really, you know, smart observation! I want to read more from this person!" And then, you know, to find something you found interesting, you have to go play detective.

<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

We have less than six minutes left and suddenly James finally verbalises the crime he actually committed - stealing the words and thoughts and opinions of others. I can only assume he left this so late in the video with the hopes that nobody would actually watch this far. This sentence is the one time he really talks about plagiarism. Then he pivots back to "I thought putting their names in the credits would be fine"  and rambles some more about how he just should have done proper citations.

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And so, yes, just putting their name in the opening credits was wrong. I thought it was cool and, you know, cinematic, but it was wrong. Citations should have been done properly. There should never have been just chunks of text being put into videos. There were times, like with uh [the queer history of Hollywood videos](pW_RjbZYi1s) that I released this past spring. They were based *directly* on *The Celluloid Closet* by Vito Russo. The book, not the documentary. I expanded on it quite a bit, but it was based directly on Vito's work, and I credited him in the opening credits. And I thought it was okay to just do that? Because... the book was out of print... and Vito had passed away unfortunately from HIV complications due to HIV and AIDS. And I looked at it more as "extending his legacy", making sure that people knew about the work that he did. 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=rebo %}>

Less than four minutes left and he's justifying all the work he stole from Celluloid Closet and even tries to claim the video was a tribute to his legacy! James then says he now understands he should have done better. This is a huge fucking lie. As you might remember from the HBomb video, James clearly knew what he did was wrong and that the consequences of being caught would end his channel. Because when the person who first caught the plagiarism of "Tinkerbelles" in "Evil Queens" learned about his plagiarism of the Celluloid Closet, she announced she planned to compare The Celluloid Closet to Unrequited. Immediately after this was when James began his harassment campaign against her on his Patreon, Twitter, and YouTube channel. James has *always* known this behaviour was wrong, that what he is doing was not okay, and he has taken aggressive action to silence critics that tried to hold him to account. And throughout this entire video he has tried to spin a tale that he just didn't know any better and of course people have been out to get him!

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But I don't think I ever mentioned his name in those videos. He was cred&mdash; like I said, his name's in the opening credits. But I don't think I ever... verbally mentioned his name. Someone who I have *so much* respect for, who's kind of an idol of mine, and... I never mentioned his name. It wasn't because I didn't respect him or anything like that... and it also wasn't because I wanted people to think that this was all me, agai&mdash; if&mdash; if that was the case I wouldn't have put his name in the in the credits. I never... wanted people to think that this was all me.

So that's actually one of the videos I want to make... <mark num=1 fc>I want to make a... documentary-style video talking about Vito Russo...</mark> and his life, and everything that he accomplished. 'Cause he didn't just write *The Celluloid Closet*, he did a lot more than that. He's someone that people *should know* about. 

Obviously, people can research him, uh, there's books about him. But I know, you know, it's easier to sit down and watch a 20 or 30 minute YouTube video than it is to read a book. I'd like to make a video about Vito Russo, properly cited, and not just, you know, copy-pasted from a book. I want to do the work.I want to *prove*, not just to you, but to myself, that I *can* do the work. And that's why I've started making these documentaries, working on these.

And I hope, with my actions, that I can show you... that I am sorry.

I'm sorry to everyone I plagiarized. I'm sorry to... everyone I've hurt. I'm sorry to people who feel lied to. I'm sorry to people who... feel like I abused the queer community. Was never my intention. 

Again, I'm sorry to Jessie. There were actually... several other YouTubers who, uh, were very nice to me. But I feel like with everything that went down Jess&mdash; Jessie is the one that I should apologize to the most.

I'm sorry for the people who felt scammed. Who thought that Telos was a grift. It was not. It is not. 

I am very sorry...

And I hope given time... and... my actions proving it... that you can believe me.

Stuff James never addressed in the apology:
- Aside from Sean Griffin and Vito Russo, he never directly acknowledges any of the other people he stole from by name
- The rampant misogyny
- Repeated harassment of Becky Albertalli
- Misgendering trans creators 
- The Nebula incident aside from the part where he harassed Jessie - the other creators who he smeared aren't brought up at all
- Basically Todd's entire video and Todd did in fact [leave a comment about this on this apology!](https://twitter.com/ShadowTodd/status/1762203400907968680/photo/1)
