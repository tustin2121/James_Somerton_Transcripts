Over the last several years there have been demands for more LGBTQ represention in Hollywood movies. But something that many people don’t know is that the first movie to ever win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, was also <mark x num=1>the first major Hollywood film to show a gay kiss</mark>. 

<mark num=2>William A. Wellman</mark>’s film *Wings*. Released <mark num=3>in 1927</mark>. In "Wings," <mark>two World War I aviators</mark> <mark>compete for the affections of the same woman while coming to terms with their growing feelings for one another. Despite being labeled a "friendship" for the duration of the film</mark> (perhaps to circumvent censorship requirements), <mark>it is evident that these two men are developing romantic feelings for one another</mark>. Made clear by the climactic <mark>dramatic kiss</mark>. 

<mark x>Wellman's silent film captures one of the earliest examples of LGBTQ</mark> cinema <mark x>by carefully toeing the censorship line</mark>; the film examines the expressed passions of two men entangled in the conflict of WWI and the emotional torment of a forbidden connection. 

<mark x>*Wings* went on to be a box office smash</mark>, and even at a time when the film industry was quickly transitioning to sound, became the only truly silent film <mark x>to win Best Picture</mark>.

Confirmed: The winner of the [First Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Academy_Awards)'s (then) "Outstanding Picture" category was [Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_(1927_film)).

Prior to the Production Code, LGBT characters were somewhat prevalent, if heavily stereotyped and exploited, in a number of major films. The 1920s especially were a time of shifting societal norms and expanding artistic experimentation. As women rode the first wave of feminism and prohibition was increasingly challenged, filmmakers began to expand their boundaries and feature more controversial plotlines. This set the stage for *Wings* which was directed by <mark num=2>William A. Wellman</mark> <mark num=3>in 1927</mark> and featured what is considered <mark x num=1>the first gay kiss in an American film</mark>.

Wings follows <mark>two Air Force pilots in World War I,</mark> Jack and Dave, who <mark>compete for the affections of a beautiful girl before discovering the true love they feel for each other. While the relationship is referred to repeatedly as a friendship</mark>, the acting and directing of the film make <mark>it obvious that the men’s feelings were romantic</mark>. The storyline ends when one of the men is fatally injured. He dies in his lover’s arms after a <mark>passionate kiss</mark>. Despite the condemnation of gay men in society as a whole at this time period, the film is surprisingly respectful of love between the two characters (Denesi). The camera remains mostly still in a tight shot of Jack and Dave embracing as they share a final goodbye. Jack assures Dave as he nears death that nothing meant more to him than their relationship. A swell of romantic string instruments play in the background as Jack mourns over Dave’s still body. The directing choices made by Wellman humanized both characters and allowed the audience to experience the tragedy without exploiting the perceived exoticness of a relationship between two men. <mark x>This film is exemplary of many films featuring gay characters in the 1920s</mark>. Wellman escaped criticism over his inclusion of gay characters <mark x>by very carefully walking the line</mark> between friends and lovers. To anyone not paying close attention, Jack and Dave could easily pass as close friends. <mark x>The movie was incredibly well-received</mark> and was <mark x>chosen as Best Picture for the 1927–1928 cycle</mark>. However, not all films featuring LGBT characters handled the issue as sensitively as *Wings*. One of the earliest kisses featuring two women was featured in Morocco, a 1930 film directed by Josef Von Sternberg.

But *Wings* is actually not where our story begins. The history of Hollywood has always had an asterisk beside it. Hidden in the footnotes in tiny little print, are the queer actors, filmmakers, executives, and tradespeople that helped turn Hollywood from a backwater orange grove in California to the city in which thousands of young dreamers make their way each year in hopes of becoming a star. It’s a long story. And like most classic American tales… it actually doesn’t begin in America at all.

These stupid titles are impossible to read because the font is so thin, spaced out, miniscule, and white over yellow most of the time. If I had to suffer, so should you, muahahaha.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box_(1929_film)#Rediscovery_and_restoration) states that the movie was "rediscovered" in the 1950s. [A much more in-depth source](http://filmint.nu/louise-brooks-and-the-exhibition-history-of-pandoras-box-1929-thomas-gladysz/) says that it started in wider circulation in the 1962 after decades of occasional showings.

The rough, no nonsense masculine <mark>image of the film business</mark> <mark>was constantly at odds with its reputation for feyness</mark>, just as was journalism. <mark>The sissy was used</mark> onscreen and off, as both <mark>scapegoat</mark> and weapon, to expose a mistrust of brightness or wit in men who were not also pushy or aggressive. In his book *See No Evil*, censor Jack Vizzard recalls an informal chat with Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn at which several other Hays Office representatives were present. Cohn was describing how he had planned to have his current big star, Grace Moore, sing "La Marseillaise" at the fall of the Bastille in her new film, and censor Geoffrey Shurlock interrupted with, "You can't do it, Harry. The Marseillaise wasn't written until three years after the fall of the Bastille."

"Who cares?" Cohn shouted. "Who would know a thing like that but a queer like you, anyway?"

Onscreen this kind of hostility was stated hardly more delicately, but since homosexuality did not officially exist, the thrust of such basically homophobic sentiment was directed elsewhere. Symbols of masculinity were defended by the use of sumbols for homosexuality. <mark>The fact that most early movie sissies were homosexual only if one chose to see them as being homosexual was simply a reflection of the fact that the existence of homosexuals in society was acknowledged only when society chose to do so.</mark> Although the presence of sissies in the Thirties and Forties did not imply that homosexuality in fact existed, it implied that homosexuals could exist if things were topsy-turvy, and it provided a subtextual reminder that the basic illusion of America was pretty shabby.

Taken from its use in British boarding schools as a term for underclassmen "fagging" for upperclassmen, the word in underworld jargon denoted a subservient person or lackey, especially young men "used" for favors. Edward G. Robinson's side kick Johnny in Little Caesar (1931) was such a character, when he decides to give up the rackets to be a tap dancer, Robinson cracks, "Dancin' just ain't my idea of a man's game."

*Rocky Horror* was shining a spotlight on the *dimly* lit representation of queer monsters in the 1930s golden age of Hollywood. Giving them one last hurrah as a posthumous victory against the Hayes code, which collapsed *entirely* just a few years before its release. 

But back in the 1930s, filmmakers still had to be clever about coding the characters, specifically to make it past the censors. 

General American audiences though could easily see through the coding. However, it wasn’t long before the easily read coding... was forced to become almost, if not completely illegible.

If you’d like to see more historical videos like this, as well as my usual video essays, podcasts, behind the scenes videos, and a whole lot more, please consider joining my Patreon, linked in the description. YouTube does have a habit of hiding queer content, especially educational queer content, so it’s only because of my patrons that I can do videos like this. And for as little as a dollar a month you can join this surprisingly awesome community that keeps this channel going. Okay, Now that I’ve awkwardly promoted my Patreon, I’ll let the credits roll and I’ll see you soon for "Unrequited Episode 2: The Invisible Men".
