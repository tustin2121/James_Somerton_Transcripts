We've <span stat:id="malaprop">romanced<sup class="add">[sic: romanticized?]</sup></span> the serial killer for a long time. Mads Mikkelsen's portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in the criminally canceled show *Hannibal* is a great example of this. Thomas Harris' bread and butter character is fictional, and not only fictional but such a carnivalesque mix of sophistication, intellect, and brutality that I couldn't really say it passes for realistic. Hannibal lacks the quiet chaos that real life serial killers possess. Though Dahmer was also a cannibal serial killer, he lacked the "eat the rude" principles that Hannibal Lecter lived by.

<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Hardly a principled serial killer himself, Dahmer lacked Lecter's discipline to stop at just cannibalism, and also engaged in necrophilia and pedophilia. But the major difference between the two is that Hannibal Lecter's victims are all as fictional as he is, and so are the families of his victims. That is not the case for Dahmer's victims. It can be a lot to deal with, seeing the man who murdered your son or brother be glorified on billboards and ads on YouTube. Imagine getting that jump scare when you're looking up a cake decorating tutorial.

Lest we forget, Dahmer was a serial killer, necrophile, paedophile, and a cannibal. What might be entertaining for viewers is deeply traumatising for the families of those affected by the crimes being reenacted on screen.

In April of 2021, [I released a video looking at the controversial Korean manhwa *Killing Stalking*](ujmgqNyZ190), the story of a young man who is abducted by a maniacal serial killer and over the course of the series falls madly in love with him. The series ends with them both (presumed) dead.

<mark yikes>The audience for *Killing Stalking* seemed to be split between people who enjoy dark complex horror stories (me) and teenage girls who were rooting for Yoon Bum and his captor, Oh Sangwoo... to come out of it as a happy couple.</mark> Because if you talk to a social worker, working out your problems with a violent abuser and finding some common ground is absolutely... not the objective.

I wasn't disturbed that people romanticized a fictional serial killer. Like I said, Hannibal Lecter has been romanticized even by his own creator. Granted, Fannibals were a little bit more... measured in their shipping of Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter, a ship name referred to as Hannigram. Instances of Will and Hannibal as a happy couple were usually depicted in alternate realities, where they could be together.<sup cn></sup> Fans recognized that this was impossible in the canonical world the characters lived in, but the chemistry was so intense an AU for them had to be created. This nuance did not... does not seem to be present in much of the *Killing Stalking* fandom, where the fervor for the violent deranged serial killer Oh Sangwoo was almost exclusively derived from how sexy he looked.

So... should I be surprised that there is a visceral thirst for Dahmer coming from the same age group? No. Am I shocked anyway? Yes, shocked, and disappointed, and grossed out, and uncomfortable. Because unlike Hannibal Lecter or Oh Sangwoo, Jeffrey Dahmer was a real person, and his victims were real people with real friends and real families who grieved for the loss of their loved ones, who were already going through a rough time seeing the story of their murders brought back to light by a major Netflix series. And now have to deal with a sizable portion of the Internet talking about how cute or handsome Jeffrey Dahmer was, and how he deserved a break because they "get" him.

Honeys, among other things he wanted sex slaves. Sex slaves. And not in a fun, consensual, kink kind of a way, he enjoyed conducting chemical lobotomies to get what he wanted. Is there really a "I can change him mentality" to approaching these serial killers? That all he needs is the right person to change? That killing people and the other stuff is just a little wuirk that you can iron out? I know women who have been trying to get their men to wash their beard trimmings out of the bathroom sink for years with no luck, I don't know where you think you're gonna get with "stop being a psycho."

Is this a problem with media itself? Has the American pop culture fiction cycle pushed the role of the main character to be something warranting empathy and understanding without exception? Among the tropes, structures, and sensibilities of American fictions, is it just automatically taken for granted that the main character is an empathizable figure whose role, through *any* despicable actions, is ultimately redemption?

One of the parts of this odd phenomenon that I've noticed is that while girls of a certain age are acting like Jeffrey Dahmer was Harry Styles, not everyone is lining up with them. And by everyone, I mean the gays... You know, his victims.

We gays are notorious for thirsting over guys we really shouldn't, and also for being obsessed with true crime.<sup cn></sup> But this seems to be one of the few exceptions, and for good reason. Gay men have been living under the shadow of Jeffrey Dahmer for as long as I've been alive. As the AIDS crisis was running rampant, and the community was only just starting to receive any large scale sympathy from the hetero majority, up pops the news of this gay male serial killer, who isn't just killing his victims, but zombifying them, eating them, and melting their bodies in vats of acid. He was a harsh example of what straight people always said we were, that we were deviants and monsters, never to be trusted. And he was the perfect poster child for this, a nearly unparalleled monster.

Nobody talked about the fact that the reason he got away with his crimes for so long was because he was targeting gay men, especially men of color, two groups the police notoriously couldn't give two shits about helping. People only talked about the cannibal queer and how certainly he wouldn't be the last to rise up to this prominence.<sup cn></sup> The most disturbing aspect is how he was able to carry on his career for as long as he did. By picking gay men of color, he was able to escape the scrutiny of law enforcement. Dahmer for this reason is an uncomfortable reminder, not only of violence against the community, but that members of the community can be a horrible detriment to our reputation. And a reminder that not very long ago, we weren't worth the law's time, that we were nobodies to everybody, and it didn't matter how loud we screamed, the world had us on mute.

And in many sections of the United States, this fear of gay men never went away. Even today these people are influenced by Dahmer when they fight against gay rights. They associate his heinous crimes with others in the queer community, because if one of us could be a monster, that means we all could be. After the discovery of Dahmer's crimes, there was a rash of hate crimes against gay men across the United States, with vigilante mobs out to make sure that the next Jeffrey Dahmer, the next monster queer, wouldn't get a chance to find his victims.

<h4>7. Jeffrey Dahmer inspired violent hate mobs</h4>

Okay, I did a lot of hunting for these supposed anti-gay hate mobs and I came up with a big ol' nothing. The closest thing I found was a reference to a spike in hate crimes in Milwaukee after Dahmer was arrested there<sup cn>1</sup>, but that turned out to be mostly harassment, not violence. The only violence it mentioned was school bullying.<sup cn>2</sup> 

So if Somerton is talking about stuff that happened elsewhere, or he means like a more indirect link between hate crimes and Dahmer, uh I- I can't prove or disprove that without more details about what he's referring to. But, I would point out that anti-gay bigots were mostly pro-Dahmer, not anti.<sup cn>2</sup> The popular perception of Dahmer was as a killer *of* gay men, not a gay man himself.<sup cn>1</sup> That was a relatively obscure detail until recently. [A screenshot of a collection of tweets of users admitting they didn't know that Dahmer was gay.] At the time hate groups would do things like call Dahmer a hero, or they'd invoke him as a threat against gay people<sup cn>2</sup> the same way neo-nazis invoke Hitler to threaten Jews. 

In fact, Somerton himself talks later in the video about how Dahmer's homosexuality was buried in the news coverage. Yeah, so while I cannot be 100% sure on this one, I think the evidence I found points to these mobs being made up.

And so the queer community, especially gay men, have lived with Dahmer's spectre for three decades. So you'd be hard-pressed to find a lot of gay men thirsting over the killer online. Evan Peters, yes, we've been drooling over him since he first showed up in *American Horror Story*, but not the *actual* Jeffrey Dahmer, and not Evan Peters' portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer.

In fact, there was a huge pushback when the series was released because it was tagged as LGBTQ on Netflix, presumably because of Dahmer's own sexuality and the sexualities of his victims. But while the queer community fights back against a renewed push to remove our rights, do we want people seeing LGBTQ tagged to Jeffrey <u>[silenced] *Fucking*</u> Dahmer when they're browsing Netflix? No.

And so the community, in a rare moment of agreement, demanded Netflix remove the tag. [And they did](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/dahmer-lgbtq-tag-netflix-removes-category-backlash-1235387213/), which considering Netflix's pig-headedness when it comes to defending transphobic comedians on their platform, kind of shocked me. They're not exactly well known for doing what the queer community asks of them these days. They probably had the wherewithal to realize that Dahmer's existence as a serial killer was due in large part to homophobia and racism, so they didn't want to stick their hand into that particular hornet's nest.

If he only targets people who have it comin', then there's no cause for concern if you live by the straight and narrow. Regardless of how this betrays malice and laziness on the police force, culminating in decades of police abuse and neglect. How many other people disappear because the police don't think they're worth their time? How many that we never, ever hear about? It was almost a trope in the gay villages of big cities. Young gay men and trans people just going missing, and no one investigating it. Many hoped they'd just packed up and moved home, but most knew it was never something quite so innocent.

Despite his cannibalism, despite the decades long erasure of his victims, these women (and mostly teenage girls) are swooning over him. And why not? To our knowledge, Dahmer never killed any teenage girls or any women at all, so there's a level of disconnection, just like with *Killing Stalking*. Would the teenage fans of *Killing Stalking* be so in love with Oh Sangwoo if they were watching him spend each issue horrifically torturing and murdering a woman? He kills women in the series, multiple in fact, but they're barely side characters. Yoon Bum is the main event. And in my opinion, because Yoon Bum is a man, female readers are able to take in a horror story without facing the true horror of it.

In the parts of James' videos that he actually writes himself or rewrites after stealing, he *really* doesn't like women. 

I didn't wanna open this can of worms, but the thesis of the stuff he stole for this video gets completely fucked up by his rants about women being attracted to serial killers. He argues women are only attracted to Dahmer because he killed gay men and not women, which makes it easier for them to ignore the brutality of his crimes, and if he'd killed women, they wouldn't be so thirsty. 

Women are attracted to the wrong serial killer. How terrible. [...] This was a stupid tangent to begin with, but now his own video contains examples of women fancying a serial killer who killed women, so his rant about women loving Dahmer because he didn't kill women makes no sense.

<h4>17. Weird Dahmer fangirls are shipping him with his first victim</h4>

So he's making a point that the weird Jeffrey Dahmer fandom is not just creepy, but also homophobic and racist, since they're so disrespectful to Dahmer's victims, most of whom were gay men of color. I think that's a fair point. 

But then Somerton backs it up by pointing out how these fans ship Dahmer with his only straight white victim, Steven Hicks. I decided to go see this quote unquote "popular" ship for myself, uh, and I spent my morning searching through the dark corners of Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, AO3, Wattpad, LiveJournal, FanFiction.net, and based on what I saw, I don't think shipping is actually a huge part of this fandom. Unless you count shipping with yourself, 'cause a lot of people wanna fuck Jeffrey Dahmer. 

But to the extent that it is, the most popular pairing appears to be with one of Dahmer's Black victims, Tony Hughes. Now that ship mostly took off after Somerton's video. Before that, the most popular ships, uh, seem to be with other serial killers like Ted Bundy or Richard Ramirez, with the actor Evan Peters who plays Dahmer in the TV show, and with childhood friend John Backderf who wrote the comic *My Friend Dahmer* about him. 

I also saw all sorts of one-off crack pairings like with Harry Styles, Eleven from *Stranger Things*, Chainsaw Man, a character from *Teen Wolf*, a member of the K-pop group TXT, a character from *Danganronpa* <u>[picture of Komaeda Nagito]</u>, Pip from *South Park*, at which point I decided I had to stop looking at this shit, but I didn't see a single one involving Steven Hicks.

<mark num=2>This change was welcomed</mark> <mark num=1>by those espousing a liberal politics of assimilation.</mark> <mark num=4>Dahmer's sexual orientation had nothing to do with his becoming a serial killer,</mark> <mark num=3>the argument went,</mark> so <mark num=4>references to his sexual orientation were inappropriate in media coverage of the killings.</mark> <mark>But if Dahmer's sexual orientation could not be mentioned, neither could institutional homophobia.</mark> Liberal celebrations of individualism generally identify prejudice and success as manifestations of personal achievements or failings, and so can only look at individuals as repositories of humanistic or anti-egalitarian values, rather than at the formation of these individuals through socially constructed and institutionally enforced power relations. The result, then, of media attempts at liberal tolerance was that the occlusion of Dahmer's gayness also occluded the identification and discussion of societal homophobia in general, and specifically of the external and internalized homophobia that might have contributed to Dahmer's development as a serial killer, of Dahmer's own homophobia that might have led him to kill gay men, of the possible effects of homophobia on the men whom Dahmer killed, and of the possibility that institutional homophobia might have made them more accessible to the murderous Dahmer.<sup>3</sup> Of course, I cannot conclusively assert that Dahmer's homosexuality turned him into a serial killer, but such a teleology is possible, <mark>given the overwhelming evidence that Dahmer had internalized societal homophobia to such an extent that he felt guilt, shame, discomfort, and hatred about his own homosexuality,</mark> and that <mark>a logical</mark> <mark>result of these feelings could have been the urge to destroy those with whom he attempted to satisfy his proscribed sexual desires.<sup>4</sup></mark> <mark>However, with gayness out of the way,</mark> Dahmer could be constructed as an inexcusable monster, and <mark>the society around him could escape being implicated in his crimes.<sup>5</sup></mark>

<sup>3</sup> Only a few writers lamented the fact that homophobia had not been put on trial with Jeffrey Dahmer. Schmidt (1994, 84) documents this argument.

<sup>4</sup> Every account of the Dahmer case that I have read and that mentions Dahmer's gayness, points out that for almost all of his adult life Dahmer was unable to accept his homosexuality, and made disparaging remarks against other gay men. For an unusually explicit account of the role that internalized homophobia might have played in Dahmer's killings, see "Debate Rages" (1992, especially page 26). One exception to these accounts comes from Dahmer's attorney, who claimed at Dahmer's trial that his client had as an adolescent "discovered and accepted his homosexuality" (Trial [1992]). Dahmer did perhaps accept his sexuality near the end of his life. His probation officer noted in 1991, Dahmer "had admitted to self he is gay. Told agent that's the way he is so 'fuck it'" (Davis [1992], 129; Norris [1992], 219; Schwartz [1992], 84; Dvorchak & Holewa [1991], 158).

<sup>5</sup> My imputation that Dahmer's sexual orientation should have been publicly discussed would apply equally to a heterosexual serial killer; I certainly would not want to imply that a straight serial killer should be referred to as a "serial killer" while a gay serial killer is called a "gay serial killer," or that heterosexuality as an institution and as a state could not be a murderous shaping influence for a straight serial killer. Homophobia might play a part in the actions of both the gay and straight serial killers.

<mark>The few reporters who did discuss homophobia and Dahmer's gayness (mostly in LGBT magazines) tended to ignore the fact that Dahmer was white.</mark> <mark>The reluctance</mark> <mark>to discuss interracial sex in light of the Dahmer murders</mark> <mark>can be interpreted as a sign of shame</mark>, and <mark>fear of having one's sexual orientation linked to racism</mark>, or both.

<mark>During and after Dahmer's trial, the few reporters who did discuss homophobia and Dahmer's gayness (primarily in the gay media) tended to ignore the fact that Dahmer was white</mark> and that all but three of the seventeen men he murdered were of color. <mark>This reticence</mark> <mark num=4>was presumably a sign of embarrassment,</mark> <mark num=5>a dread of having gayness associated with racism,</mark> or a fear of <mark num=3>talking about interracial sex in the context of the Dahmer murders.</mark> The habit of partializing identity or of assigning individuals separate racial, gender, and sexual identities, in turn, makes it impossible to speak of Dahmer as white, male, and gay or of those he murdered as gay men of color. Usually the lineaments of white gayness are not difficult to identify. Even though the racial component of this identity is often assumed rather than articulated, gay whiteness is nevertheless normalized to such an extent that gayness is thought of only in terms of whiteness, and queer identities of color become literally unthinkable. In the case of Dahmer, though, the specification of whiteness becomes much more difficult because of the immediately and explicitly monstrous and racist connotations that whiteness takes on in this context.

<mark>According to several of Dahmer's acquaintances, he displayed a deep-seated bigotry toward African Americans and made racist comments about black gay men in particular.</mark>

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.ian_barnard at="p.72" %}>

<mark>Many of Dahmer's acquaintances report that he seemed to hate black people (and black gay men, in particular), and frequently referred to black people with racist slurs.</mark> Further, Dahmer's racial consciousness was demonstrated in his claim that he thought that Jamie Doxtator, whom he had lured to his grandmother's house in 1988 and killed, was "Hispanic" (Doxtator was Native American). Doxtator's mother later told reporters that she was initially relieved to hear that those Dahmer had killed were "black, Hispanic, and Laotian,"<sup>7</sup> since she then mistakenly believed that her Native American son was safe. Both Dahmer's and Doxtator's mother's accounts suggest that race was very much at issue, and that Dahmer was actively thinking of race when he brought men of color to his home prior to killing them. In addition, it seems that Dahmer's victims were mostly poor and might have felt neglected and vulnerable in other ways, too: institutional racism produces a disproportionately high ratio of poverty, neglect, and vulnerability among people of color in the U.S., and thus even the class status and degree of self-esteem of those Dahmer murdered cannot be said to be extrinsic to race.

III. *Gay Rights for a Serial Killer*

<mark>While legal and media figures learnt not to explicitly remark on Dahmer's gayness in their official representations of him, Dahmer himself invoked what we might think of as gay rights strategies</mark> (i.e., strategies that share discursive space with the liberal logic of gay civil rights and identity politics) <mark>in the course of his growing momentum as a serial killer</mark> and his consequent run-ins with and escapes from the law. <mark num=4>As with the media's belated ignoring of Dahmer's gayness,</mark> <mark num=3>these practices</mark> <mark>suggest the limitations and dangers of a liberal gay rights discourse.<sup>9</sup></mark>

<sup>9</sup> One of the few Dahmer texts that does point to societal homophobia as a cause of Dahmer's killings is Hirsch (1996). In his efforts to establish a larger social accountability for Dahmer, Hirsch also delineates the continuities between the Dahmer phenomenon and other social discourses. However, in his zeal to claim Dahmer's victimhood, Hirsch does not account for what might be read as Dahmer's cynical deployment of the same gay rights discourse that informs Hirsch's article. Hirsch also does not develop any theory of race in the Dahmer case, though he does several times mention the races of the men Dahmer killed.

Commentators have bemoaned the fact that Dahmer had so many brushes with an incompetent or unobservant legal system and with other state officials (a probation officer, for instance) prior to his final arrest, and yet was able to continue killing. If the law and the others had been more vigilant and more conscientious, this argument goes, Dahmer might have been caught sooner, and several lives could have been saved. In one such early encounter, <mark>Dahmer was convicted of sexual assault and of enticing a child for immoral purposes in 1989.<sup>10</sup></mark> <mark>In his remarks to the judge successfully soliciting the judge's leniency, Dahmer came out: he told the judge that he was gay.<sup>11</sup></mark> In a chillingly magnified version of this plea two years later, Dahmer came out to two police officers who were summoned by neighbors when a drugged fourteen year old Konerak Sinthasomphone escaped from Dahmer's apartment. The policemen returned Sinthasomphone to Dahmer's custody and left the scene after Dahmer convinced them that Sinthasomphone was his adult lover.<sup>12</sup> Dahmer killed Sinthasomphone shortly afterwards.

Does this sound like the man anyone, let alone teenage girls, should be lusting over? Having a thing for serial killers isn't new, and it hasn't risen up just because of shows on Netflix. There are several online communities, such as blogs and message boards, where fans of serial killers like Bundy and Dahmer and Richard Ramirez and others express their adoration for these individuals, as if they may be a pop star. However, as evidenced by the statements made by the families of Dahmer's victims, and the show's proclivity for trying to understand the killer rather than to tell the stories of his victims simply because the killer was a moderately attractive white man, maybe adaptations of these stories can arguably create more harm than good.

This is much worse than the situation with *Killing Stalking* because although the thirst was and is real for Oh Sangwoo, he, like Hannibal Lecter before him, was a fictional character who never actually hurt anyone. The creation of an artist is a commentary on our willingness to forgive nearly anything if someone is attractive. But Dahmer was real, and his victims were real, and the pain their families suffered still is very much real.

So maybe the next time a producer greenlights a movie or streaming series about a notorious serial killer, perhaps they should refrain from playing armchair psychologist, pretending that their movies or series can give some new insight into the killer that hasn't already been gleaned by criminal psychiatrists long before now. And instead, focus on the people whose lives they took. They are the people we really ought to remember.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

James says all this, but he treats the victims like an afterthought throughout the video. He gives lipservice to the pain of their families, but all he really does is read out the victims' from a Wikipedia article and tells us nothing about them except for how they died. The only thing that people will remember from watching this video is the misogyny.

So, I'd like to gather stories from the victims and their families, concentrating not on the brutality of the murders but on the vibrant lives that the victims lived, and also focusing on the families' experiences in the following years. I found some [here](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2022/09/28/jeffrey-dahmers-17-victims-and-what-we-knew-them-errol-lindsey-rita-isbell-anthony-tony-hughes/10443235002/)
