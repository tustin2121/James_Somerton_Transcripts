Hello everyone, my name is James and welcome to Gay Geek Theory. Today I would like to talk about something that I'm calling the "Stonewall Effect", or maybe the "Stonewall Film Effect". 

As someone who has gone to film school, worked in the film industry, and then also gotten a business degree and worked in marketing, I *feel* like I have a pretty good view of the film industry from, you know, from a distance. A very far distance. Like, surface of the Moon on October 31st distance.

This intro seems a lot more unscripted for being called a "video essay". Or at least there's a lot more "um"s in here than his later work.

The time at which the moon is furthest from the earth varies from year to year. In 2016, the moon was indeed farthest from the earth (most distant apogee) on October 31, but in 2017, it was on December 19. This year (2024), it will be farthest away on October 2. There's a neat lunar calculator [here](https://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/pacalc.html), try it out for yourself if you'd like!

Showing violence, sex, and "questionable" moral behavior <span visual={{tcc}} on="14:09" off="14:20">were an easy way to get people talking about a movie and then getting their butts in theater seats.

<span visual={{tcc}} on="15:08" off="15:11">they forced the film industry as a whole</span>

I could not find any documentation of that last statement.

<comment {% include commenter for=tustin %}>

It seems to be maybe a mix up of a lot of disparate facts? There were two TV series named "Queer as Folk" when this was written. The UK version (1999-2000) had ~30min episodes for season 1 and ~45min episodes for season 2. The US version (2000-2005) had five seasons and across all seasons had a variable episode length between 44 and 58 minutes. So... he's taking the hour-length episodes of the US series and attributing the 15 minutes added by the UK series...??

Then came... the Bush administration, and gay representation, at least from mainstream Hollywood studios, seemed to dry up. Sure, <mark fc=false>we got *The Hours* (which didn't turn a profit)</mark> and some independent fare like *Mambo Italiano* and *Monster* (again, not exactly a positive portrayal). And I guess you could argue that *Chicago* is pretty gay? And that Frodo and Sam might have had something going on the down-low? But you'd be reaching. 

<span visual="xmen2" on="?" off="?">For the first few years, the closest thing to a gay movie that any major Hollywood studio put out was *X-Men 2*. <mark fc=false id="bi_erasure" stat:id="y-biphobia">Gay director Bryan Singer</mark> slathered the mutant-as-gay metaphor all over that movie. But just like *The Lord of the Rings* and *Chicago*, it's subtext,</span> and we're looking for plain, simple *text* here.

<comment id="hours_profit" {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

*The Hours* did alright profit-wise; it had a budget of $25 million and it earned over $108 million at the box office worldwide. Not a huge success, but it certainly made some money. It also won two Golden Globes and an Academy Award, among dozens of other nominations and awards.

Also, [Bryan Singer is bisexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Singer#Personal_life), not gay. (And a pretty awful guy, but that's besides the point.)

<u>[On screen, filling most of the screen]: "2005"</u>

Then along came 2005. I like to think of 2005 as a test case for queer cinema. 

<span visual="rent" on="?" off="?">First up, *Rent*, a rock opera about straights, gays and bisexuals living and singing together in AIDS-infested early 90s New York City!</span> Cost 40 million dollars to produce and made... 31 million dollars at the worldwide box office. 

Here's some box office info you may not actually know: Theaters take about half of the money that a movie makes, so... a movie needs to make twice as much as its budget in order for the studio to break even, and that's not even *counting* the cost of advertising the movie. So when you look at it that way, *Rent* was an even bigger bomb. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Next we have *Capote*. 7 million dollar production budget with a worldwide box office of just under 50 million. Okay, now we're talking. Nothing to write home about, but at least it turned a profit. Hollywood is a business after all, and they love making money. 

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">Finally we have *Brokeback Mountain*, a movie people are still angry about not winning Best Picture at the Oscars. This movie is sometimes credited as being the *moment* a lot of Americans realize that gay people can actually *love each other*, and it's not just about sex. Made for 14 million dollars, it brought in 178 million dollars at the worldwide box office. Those are the kinds of numbers that Hollywood likes to see.</span>

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But here's the thing: looking at 2005 from a business standpoint, *Brokeback Mountain* is the outlier. *Capote* did well, yes, but not anywhere beyond what other movies of its ilk were doing at the time or now, meaning Oscar-bait movies. And of course *Rent* was a total bomb. So *Brokeback Mountain* was the... was breaking the rule that gay movies don't make money. 

So, what would happen? Well, Hollywood would *test* the gay community.

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">In 2006, we got *Running with Scissors*. Based on the best-selling book of the same name, producers were hoping for a *big* return. Sadly, it was a terribly made movie and it bombed.</span> Producers and executives didn't see a bad movie that lost money though, they saw a *gay* movie that lost money. 

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">In 2009, *Milk* won two Oscars, but failed to turn a profit.</span> 

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

Honestly, I'd argue that *Milk* did alright too, especially considering the DVD sales, but whatever, it wasn't a blockbuster, I don't think anyone expected it to be one, it's a biopic about gay rights.

<james {% include timecode %}>

So now that we've got some context, let me get to the reason why I call this the "Stonewall Effect", or the "Stonewall Film Effect". <span visual="stonewall" on="?" off="?">The next time Hollywood as a studio system put *real* faith behind a gay movie was 2015, ten years after *Brokeback Mountain*.</span> 

<span visual="stonewall" on="?" off="?">Directed by Roland Emmerich, the movie did what every historical movie has done and whitewashed the story. It wasn't drag queens, gay, and transgender people of color who started the fight for gay rights,</span> it was a pretty blonde boy from Kansas! Or Nebraska...! One of the flat states!

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<span visual="stonewall" on="?" off="?">Because of this, there was a fierce campaign against the movie online. Boycotts were planned, and what Hollywood hoped would turn into the first gay blockbuster turned into a massive tax write-off,</span> <mark fc=false>making only 187,000 dollars worldwide</mark>... Yeah... missin' a few zeroes there guys. 

</james>
<comment id="stonewall_domestic" {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

*Stonewall* made $187,000 *domestically*; it made $293,000 worldwide. Not that the difference is particularly meaningful. Honestly, it seems like it was just a bad movie; the reviews were abysmal. But yes, there was backlash and boycotts too.

</comment>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<span visual="stonewall" on="?" off="?">So what is the Stonewall Film Effect? It's when a gay movie fails because of a reason other than being about gay people. Hollywood executives, however, don't see that; they see a *gay* movie that lost money. They see a *gay* movie being protested. Gays boycotted *Silence of the Lambs* in 1991, but it made 272 million dollars.</span>

<span visual="stonewall" on="?" off="?"><u>[mockingly]</u> So it wasn't the boycott that made Stonewall fail, it was because it was about *gay people!* *Audiences obviously don't want gay movies!* Maybe a supporting character and a cheap rom-com or chick flick here and there, but no lead roles. </span>

<u>[serious again]</u> You see, every gay movie that fails, fails because it's a gay movie, but every gay movie that succeeds, succeeds for a different reason. Case in point: *The Birdcage* starred Robin Williams at his prime. *Philadelphia* starred Tom Hanks and won him an Oscar. *Brokeback Mountain* had two of the hottest actors in Hollywood, and happened *right* after George W. Bush started his campaign against gay marriage, so there was a little sympathy. Now I'm not saying these are the reasons that these movies succeeded... but this is what Hollywood executives tell themselves. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So where does that leave us? Well, as a gay man who would actually like to see some major gay characters in movies, I'm at an impasse. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">From a business standpoint, my view is that we (meaning the LGBT community) should go out and see every movie that features LGBT characters, whether they're gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, or transgender people, *see them all*.</span> Every one of them, in theaters, and buy the blu-ray, no matter how terrible they are. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

"But James, that means Hollywood will just keep making *bad* gay movies!" Ah, that's the counter-argument. And, you know, if we support movies like *Stonewall* which whitewash and ciswash history, Hollywood will just keep making movies like *that*... Fair argument. And history *kind of* backs you up, to a point.

<james {% include timecode %}>

For decades, African Americans were portrayed in two ways in movies: dangerous criminals, or slaves. That was it. It's like the scary butch dyke, gay best friend, or depressed transgender person stereotypes the LGBT community hates. 

But eventually you got the blaxploitation movement in the 1970s, which despite its name sounding kind of negative, actually went a long way in introducing audiences to strong Black characters, *Shaft* and *Foxy Brown* for instance. Were they great movies? *Not always*, sure we look back and cringe at some of them now, but they laid the groundwork for movies to star Eddie Murphy and Denzel Washington in the 1990s, and make a lot of money doing it.

And then that laid the groundwork for more "overtly Black" movies like the *Madea* series in the 2000s and the 2010s, which then laid the groundwork for *Black Panther*, a 200 million dollar superhero movie with an almost all Black cast taking place in a technologically superior African nation. No Stepin Fetchit's here; our main character, a superhero, is a king.

<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So where's our gay superhero? They do exist: Marvel's Wiccan and Hulkling, DC's Midnighter and Apollo... so where are they? Well, they remain relegated to the pages of limited yet popular comic book runs because we (meaning the LGBTQ community) haven't shown the Hollywood executives that we're willing to spend our money on gay movies. We need to deal with the bad gay movies like *Running with Scissors*, *Rent*, and yes, maybe even *Stonewall*. Line up around the block to see them, support them, and put our hard-earned dollars into the bloated wallets of Hollywood executives, because when they see *bad* gay movies succeeding, they'll start buying up those *good* gay movies whose screenplays get ignored.

In 2016, *Moonlight*, a gay *and* Black movie, was made for 1.5 million dollars. People heard it was good, *we* heard it was good, and we went! It made 65 million dollars worldwide. For a movie about a gay Black man, that's pretty good! I'd say it's exceptional actually, if you look at the box office performance of other movies like that? 

So we've got one Oscar winning box office hit on our hands, first time since Brokeback Mountain ten years ago, over 10 years ago... so what are we gonna do now? 

</james>
<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

This time, are we going to ignore the next LGBT inclusive movie because it wasn't made *exactly* like we wanted it to be? Or are we going to swallow our here-and-queer pride and support LGBT cinema, even when it's not great. Because remember, it took a lot of slave movies and terrible comedies to get to *Black Panther*.

So let's show Hollywood we mean business. The next time an LGBT inclusive movie hits a theater near you,

If gays have shown anything, it's that we're good at forcing otherwise slow processes to speed up. Change in Hollywood can make change in Washington look damn near supersonic. *Unless* there's money involved. You want gay movies? You want lesbian heroes, bisexual leading men, a transgender superhero? Let's put our money where our mouths are and support gay cinema... even the bad ones. 

You've gotta start somewhere, and after a century of cinema... we're still at the starting gate.
