<u>[James pours some alcohol into a glass with a large ice cube, then takes a sip.]</u>

For anyone who has followed my channel for any amount of time, and certainly anyone who follows me on Twitter or watches my live streams, it won’t come as any shock that Harry Potter was a formative piece of media for me. And I also might be one of the cisgender men who is most enraged by Harry Potter’s author, JK Rowling, and her… *presumably…* recent fall into Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism. 

She has spent the last several years honing her cruceatus curse on<ins>to</ins> the trans community around the globe. But especially trans women in the UK. She doesn’t often speak of trans men but don’t worry, when she does, her talking points are just as backward as when she talks about trans women.

The situation has grown ever more fraught since her first ‘middle-aged moment’ tweets in June of 2020. Now this is the point in the video when someone will jump down to the comments with the: “Tell me what she said that’s transphobic. *Tell me what she’s done.* ***None of you people can seem to tell me.***”

<u>[Above is increasingly distorted and red.]</u>

I’ve seen so many comments like this that it's literally become a joke. But luckily people actually HAVE cataloged what she’s done. And I could leave links in the description to articles that line these out, but we all know <del>they</del><ins>these people</ins> won’t read them, <mark fc>so forgive me for using Abby Gardner’s breakdown from glamour.com as my jumping off point here.</mark>

But first, I want to say that this video is brought to you by my patrons. YouTube has been in a mood lately and isn’t even notifying subscribers who click the bell when a new video comes out, so the views and Adsense for this channel have sucked lately. So its<sup class="add">[sic: it's]</sup> really thanks to our patrons that we can keep this channel going. Without them we would have had to stop a long time <ins>ago</ins>. So if you like the videos we make, and have the means, even a dollar or two a month, I would be so grateful if you signed up for our Patreon, linked in the description. Patrons gain access to videos early, plus behind the scenes clips, a weekly podcast, movie watch a long parties, not-so-youtube-safe versions of videos, and a lot more. So if you’re able to support the channel this way, I couldn’t thank you enough. And if you’re not able to, which is very understandable in this economy, likes, comments and shares go a long long way.

<u>[Typewriter effect title card]: "INSTANCE No. 1"</u>

<mark>On June 6 of the cursed year of 2020, Joanne tweeted out an article</mark> from devex.com calling for a more equal world post covid 19. <mark>Specifically for people who menstruate. She took issue with the term “People who menstruate”, tweeting:</mark>

<u>[When James reads out Joanne's tweets, it's with an artificially modified high-pitched voice.]</u>

> <mark></mark>'People who menstruate.'  
I'm sure there used to be a word for those people.  
Someone help me out.  
Wumben?  
Wimpund?

This is just one of the many instances of Joanne erasing trans men and non-binary people from her gilded little world.

<mark>Notwithstanding the massive backlash she received after the original tweet,</mark> when she could have thought about what she said and fixed this whole issue before it took over so much of our lives, <mark>she went on to elaborate on her beliefs in a longer piece.</mark> 

<u>[The same voice reads out the following, quote scrolling on screen]:</u>

<u>[Rolling eyes.]</u> First of all, this is tangential to a kind of academic gaslighting. She’s trying to convince you that two things are self-evident that aren’t necessarily related. In the fight for trans rights — nobody is really trying to argue that sex doesn’t exist in order to justify the existence of GENDER. She’s trying to gaslight gay men and women into being on her side with the ‘there’s no same sex attraction’ bit. Guess what, Joanne, you can be gay and still be attracted to trans or non-binary people. I know, we must all be *drinking* crazy juice. But as a very much confirmed gay man if someone told me I couldn’t be attracted to Laith Ashley because he’s trans, I’d tell them to *sod off.* 

Second of all! “Empathetic to trans people… because they’re vulnerable in the same way as women.” Trans women *are* women, Joanne. They don’t share a few things in common with women. They don’t just<ins>...</ins> happen to look like women. They are women.

Trans women’s lives have also been shaped by being women. Ask any trans woman how much she’s gone through to be accepted as a woman by even a fraction of the population. If that process doesn’t shape the way a person exists, I don’t know what does.

<mark>On June 10, 2020 Joanne published an essay length blog on her website called “TERF Wars”.</mark> Now I’m not going to break down that tirade because I enjoy having a<ins>...</ins> *modicum* of sanity left, But in the piece she defended her defense of Maya Forstater, <mark>who Joanne said “lost her job for what were deemed ‘transphobic’ tweets.”</mark> This is actually incorrect. 

Forstater’s contract was up for renewal at the time and it was simply not renewed. This happens all the time. Whenever you sign an employment contract for a set number of days, usually amounting to <ins>about</ins> one or two years, your employer can choose *not* to renew that contract for any reason they see fit, or for no reason at all. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.gardner at="¶ 5-6" %}>

<mark>Then, on June 10, 2020, Rowling published a lengthy post on her website and sent out a tweet that read “TERF Wars.”</mark> (TERF is an acronym that stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist.)

“This isn’t an easy piece to write, for reasons that will shortly become clear, but I know it’s time to explain myself on an issue surrounded by toxicity. I write this without any desire to add to that toxicity,” she wrote. “For people who don’t know: last December I tweeted my support for Maya Forstater, a tax specialist who’d <mark>lost her job for what were deemed ‘transphobic’ tweets.</mark> She took her case to an employment tribunal, asking the judge to rule on whether a philosophical belief that sex is determined by biology is protected in law. Judge Tayler ruled that it wasn’t.”

</from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But instead of taking the work experience and finding another job, Forstater went on a *crusade* that she has *since* turned into an enterprise, in lieu of actually advancing her original career. Turns out it pays to be bigoted… 

To this very day she goes around blaming every bad thing in the world on trans people. If you’ve got the stomach for it, go look at her Twitter account. It’s bonkers. 

So after TERF WARS came out is when many public figures and celebrities, including the younger cast members of Harry Potter, came out firmly *against* Joanne’s seemingly sudden lurch into exclusionary politics. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were the loudest voices among them. And this is when <del>the</del> Joanne simps started up the online chants of <u>[distorted]</u> **“You wouldn’t have anything without her!”** Essentially saying they never would have become famous actors were it not for her choosing them. Not taking into account that *thousands* of child actors were run through casting directors before their faces ever appeared in front of Joanne. Nevermind that the Harry Potter movies may never have become the success <ins>that</ins> they did without the charismatic young actors at the center of them. Them *daring* to disagree with her at all was tantamount to kicking her in the mud, spitting on her, and then running her over with a high speed broomstick.

<h2>Wait, how is Stephen King involved?</h2>

J.K. Rowling reportedly deleted a gushing tweet about Stephen King after the renowned horror writer tweeted in support of trans women.

Here’s what apparently went down: <mark>King retweeted a message from Rowling’s account. “Andrea Dworkin wrote: ‘Men often react to women’s words—speaking and writing—as if they were acts of violence; sometimes men react to women’s words with violence,’”</mark> Rowling tweeted on June 28, 2020. “It isn’t hateful for women [to] speak about their own experiences, nor do they deserve shaming for doing so.” 

<mark>In response, Rowling sent a now-deleted tweet praising the best-selling author.</mark> “I’ve always revered @StephenKing, but today my love reached—maybe not Annie Wilkes levels—but new heights,” she reportedly tweeted, [according to Us Weekly](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/j-k-rowling-deletes-stephen-king-tweet-after-he-supports-trans-women/). “It’s so much easier for men to ignore women’s concerns, or to belittle them, but I won’t ever forget the men who stood up when they didn’t need to. Thank you, Stephen.”

<mark>However, when a fan asked King to respond to Rowling’s transgender statements, the author replied that, “Trans women are women.”</mark>

According to Hogwarts fans on Twitter as well as to *Us Weekly*, <mark>Rowling deleted her tweet about King shortly after.</mark>

<mark>Almost one year later, King spoke about what went down, adding that Rowling also blocked the famous author on Twitter after his tweet. “Jo canceled me,” the 73-year-old told The Daily Beast in an interview published on May 20, 2021. “She sorta blocked me and all that."</mark>

<mark>July 5, 2020. Rowling goes on another tweet tirade.</mark> Pulling a tactic from the Fox News playbook:

<h2>What about the rant in July 2020?</h2>

<mark>On July 5, 2020, Rowling went on another social media rant</mark> after a Twitter user called her out for liking a tweet that compared hormone therapy to antidepressants. 

“I’ve ignored fake tweets attributed to me and RTed widely. I’ve ignored porn tweeted at children on a thread about their art. I’ve ignored death and rape threats. I’m not going to ignore this,” Rowling wrote. “When you lie about what I believe about mental health medication and when you misrepresent the views of a trans woman for whom I feel nothing but admiration and solidarity, you cross a line.”

She continued, <mark>“Many health professionals are concerned that young people struggling with their mental health are being shunted towards hormones and surgery when this may not be in their best interests.

Now, I know a fair number of trans people, both men and women, and they all have different transition journeys.

Acting like there’s an epidemic of de-transitioning going on is dumb. People do de-transition, its<sup class="add">[sic: it's]</sup> true. Sometimes it’s <ins>only</ins> for medical reasons, sometimes its<sup class="add">[sic: it's]</sup> social pressure, and sometimes they really do come to the conclusion that this isn’t who they are. 

But the amount of people who detransition, for any reason, is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the women who choose to have their breast implants removed, or the people who decide to have weight loss surgeries reversed. *Context* is *important*.

And then Her re-tweet of *this* gem. 

<u>[Reading voice even higher pitched now]</u>

> Yes they are sometimes necessary and lifesaving, but they should be a last resort - not the first option.

> Pure laziness for those who would rather medicate than put in the time and effort to heal people’s minds."

<u>[Stressed exhale.]</u> First of all, antidepressants should never be a last resort. If someone is horribly depressed Its<sup class="add">[sic: it's]</sup> safer to medicate them while going through therapy then having them spend months in therapy just to never be able to medicate them because they take their own lives.<ins>..</ins> I had a good friend in high school who was in that situation and, sadly, he’s not here anymore. **So watch what you say about therapy and medication.** 

Second, the quote “Pure laziness for those who would rather medicate than put in the time and effort to heal people's minds" *really* does come across as saying unless there’s no way to convince you that you’re not trans, *then* we’ll let you have hormones. Which sounds an AWFUL LOT like conversion therapy to me. Which, sadly, doesn’t shock me anymore since the pseudonym Joanne uses to write her over-written detective novels is the same name of [the man who *created* conversion therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Galbraith_Heath). 

She says it’s a coincidence. But was she really dumb enough to choose a fake author name without googling it first? Well, maybe, but I’ll actually give her some credit here and say she IS smart enough to do that. She just chose the name on purpose.

Now of course, trans women are *not* just men in dresses.

<h2>The new books aren’t helping: Part two.</h2>

<mark>In August</mark> 2022, Rowling began promoting her new novel, <mark>*The Ink Black Heart*</mark>, published under her pen name Robert Galbraith. In the book, which is over a thousand pages long, <mark num=2>a YouTube-based cartoonist</mark>’s <mark num=5>work is accused of being racist</mark>, <mark num=7>transphobic</mark>, and <mark num=6>ableist</mark>; she’s then <mark num=3>doxxed, threatened</mark> with rape and death, and is <mark num=4>ultimately stabbed to death in a cemetery.</mark> <mark num=8>According to one reviewer’s [take](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/jk-rowling-defends-book-character-transphobia-1235355646/)</mark>, <mark num=9>the book “takes aim” at “social justice warriors.”</mark>

But the book is *not* based on Rowling’s own controversies…says Rowling. “I should make it really clear after some of the things that have happened the last year that this is not depicting [that],” Rowling said to Graham Norton [in an interview](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/jk-rowling-defends-book-character-transphobia-1235355646/). “I had written the book before certain things happened to me online. I said to my husband, ‘I think everyone is going to see this as a response to what happened to me,’ but it genuinely wasn’t. The first draft of the book was finished at the point certain things happened.”

So that’s the timeline of events that lead to many people, myself included, believing that Joanne Rowling, author of the globally bestselling children’s fantasy book series about a boy wizard who was raised in a closet and grew up to become a cop… that states that enslaved house elves actually like being enslaved, and that everyone who wants to change the status quo is a villain… is actually a bit of a regressive transphobe.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Full disclosure, a marketing firm working <del>with</del><ins>for</ins> Avalanche Studios, the company behind the video game *Hogwarts Legacy*, sent me a review copy of the game. Which I did attempt to play. But maybe it needed a day one patch or something because the review copy’s controls were so wonky, and the voice over so disjointed from the mouth movement that I couldn’t play the thing for <ins>more than</ins> maybe 90 minutes <del>before giving up</del><ins>then I just gave up</ins> and <ins>started</ins> playing *The Last of Us* remake <ins>instead</ins>. 

So this is *not* a review of the game. Which, considering they didn’t send the game out to *actual* review sites who they thought wouldn’t be kind, I’m kind of shocked as hell that they sent it to me. I can’t even get my favorite queer authors to send me early reader copies of their books, but likely the biggest game of the year gets sent to me? After publishing two videos and countless live streams in which I *rail* against Joanne and her broken ideology? I feel like there’s a queer person working at that marketing firm who <del>was</del><ins>is just</ins> trying to sabotage it. If so, good for you! I hope you’re watching.

For months and months before this game came out… years, really. <del>The</del><ins>This</ins> thing was announced forever ago… people have been trying to build a boycott of the game. The main reason being its connection with Rowling. At least That’s the one all the *news* sites have been running with. “The crazy LGBTQLMNOP’s are boycotting the wizard game for children!” And if you’re watching the right channel, they might even include a little tag about grooming, because why the hell not?

But the queer community isn’t the only one raising the warning flag when it comes to Joanne’s work. There are plenty of people taking off the rose tinted glasses we’ve been wearing since discovering the series and finding things that are all sorts of troubling. There aren't many characters of color in the novels, and the ones that *are* there are frequently pushed to the background and given names that are outrageously stereotypical. For instance, Cho Chang is a character whose primary attributes are that she’s good at school, and she’s Asian. That’s basically it.

But it’s not just characters of color. Look at Seamus Finnigan, whose<sup class="add">[sic: who's]</sup> portrayed as dumb and *constantly* blowing things up. Because, you know, he’s Irish. 

And in case you were unaware some Irish people would like *all* of Ireland to be a unified nation and not under the thumb of England. See, beginning in 1970, the Irish Republican Army,, or IRA, fighting for independence, carried out assassinations, and ambushes in a campaign they called the “Long War.” Oh and Bombings. They carried out bombings as well. You know, blowing stuff up.

And her peculiar ideas on gender are made *clearly* evident by the fact that magic stairs prohibit guys from getting to the girls' dorm but do not prevent girls from entering into the boys' dorm.

And then… there’s the Goblin bankers. <mark>The movies created a much sharper image of the Goblins than the books did, one that many people identified with stereotypical Jewish <del>characteristics</del><ins>caricatures</ins>.

Rowling has not acknowledged or apologized for the purportedly inadvertent link</mark> despite the fact that it has been brought up countless times by many different people.

<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.uppercut at="¶ 2" %}>

As the internet and social media grew in popularity, a discussion about the goblins in Harry Potter grew with it. <mark>While the books didn’t provide much detail about the banking species, the movies painted a much clearer picture, one that many associated with Jewish stereotypes. Specifically, large hooked noses, controlling the wealth, and being greedy. There has been no acknowledgment or apology of the alleged accidental connection from Rowling about this.</mark> But let’s discuss how and WHY people are forming these connections, starting with the history of the goblin mythos. 

</from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I’m… disinclined to say that this is errant anti semitism on her part, and more… <u>[half-hearted shrug]</u> negligence? The thing is that these are almost a direct depiction of goblins as they exist in European folklore, either in appearance or behavior. Poet Christina Rosetti wrote the poem: Goblin Market, where goblins are depicted as skeezy merchants, or perhaps are an allegory for opium pushers. In the books, their appearance is less important than the attitude <del>about</del><ins>around</ins> them, naturally. 

And as being tight for cash — at *one* point in her life — I can understand that J.K. Rowling <del>may</del><ins>might</ins> not want to depict *bankers* in a positive light. The movies, however, had no excuse to depict them the way they did. And the goblins in the parks have even LESS of an excuse. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Now the reason why I say Rowling is guilty of *negligence* is because Goblins, as a mythological creature themselves, have roots in antisemitism. <mark>Some stories tie the origin of goblins to Judaism. For instance, Cornish myths suggest that Knockers (the Cornish form of goblins) came from the spirits of Jews who worked in the Cornish mines during the Middle ages.</mark> <mark>But Because the notion that goblins being based on the souls of Jews did not make sense in modern society, many of these tales about goblins did not survive the transition into modern society. Yet that's not the whole story of where the goblin came from.</mark>

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.uppercut at="¶ 3" %}>

Goblins are heavily featured in many European countries’ folklore and vary from mischievous spirits to malevolent thieves. <mark>Some stories tie the origin of goblins to Judaism. For instance, Cornish mythos suggests that Knockers (the Cornish form of goblins) came from the spirits of Jews who worked in the Cornish mines during the Middle ages.</mark> In the works of G. K. Chesterton, author of the 1908 work, Orthodoxy, the use of goblins and Jews was fluid. Even in Dickens’ work, Oliver Twist, Fagin the thief is described as “The Jew.” <mark>Many of these myths of goblins didn’t carry over to the new world because that basis, the spirits of Jews, didn’t make sense. But that’s not the full origin of the Goblin we all think of today.</mark>

“During the 6th century, the Church’s teachings and trying to convince Jews to convert to Catholicism is one of the primary origins of the people of the Jewish faith being painted with an ugly, otherly brush.” Dr. <mark>Rabbi Jo David</mark>, an independent Rabbi, stated. 

<mark>“That whole concept of the Jew as misshapen and ugly, actually comes from early Christian writings….

<mark>As an additional piece of historical context, throughout the Middle Ages Jews were given the job of working as bankers, tax collectors, and in general dealing with money because this was considered to be a job *below* that of Crusaders and landowners.</mark> And not jobs that were Christ-like. <mark>And of course the <del>N*z*s</del><ins>Nazis</ins> used goblin-like images to portray Jews in all of their propaganda.</mark>

<mark>So goblins are very deeply anchored in their own history, and for many reasons, including antisemitism, they frequently become associated with Judaism; nonetheless, the question comes back to purpose.

*Hogwarts Legacy* has, of course, sold a gazillion copies already, and will likely end up, by direct royalties, or further licensing agreements, making JK Rowling richer than she already is. She even brags about getting royalty checks on Twitter now. Because, again, she’s as petty as an eighth grader. 

I say ‘8th grader’ figuratively. I’m sure many ankle-biters have more emotional maturity than this woman is displaying.

Now what I mean by that is… Rowling already has more money than god. She *certainly* has the martyrdom complex to go with it… 

Because of the way investments work, she’d have to make a full time job of spending money to spend it fast enough to actually make a dent in her bank account. As long as she [doesn’t go buying up any social media platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk), her personal equity will grow — even without any deliberate efforts to help it along. Barring the complete dissolution of society and abandonment of all major currencies, she’s (likely) going to be richer than everyone watching this video combined… forever. For any exceptions to that statement, the link to my Patreon can be found below. 

There is no changing that. Boycotting a game or a movie or eventual TV show will never hurt her bank balance. Not in any significant way. And certainly not in a way that matters to *her*. Even though *Fantastic Beasts* BOMBED, she’s almost entirely unbothered. The failure of the movies has not seemed to affect *or* soften her stance on social issues. Even if she financed an entire harry potter movie HERSELF, whether it succeeds or not, won’t change her spending (or hoarding) of power. Money seems to matter LESS to her than this platform <ins>does</ins>.

People boycotted *Captain Marvel* because… powerful women, and *Beauty and the Beast* for having two gays spin in a circle for a few frames. But all of those movies made a fortune. People have boycotted video games for being racist, <ins>and</ins> sexist, <ins>and</ins> homophobic, you name it. But the games still go on to make a ton of money for the studios.

There is no guarantee that a problem created by capitalism can be solved<del>…</del> with more capitalism. And choosing to withhold your financial support for various services or goods for whatever reason is still… capitalism. Boycotts are risky. Very risky. A boycott would hurt an independant caffe. It would not — and has not — and will not — hurt Starbucks. For all the people you may get invested into your boycott, a corporation has the capital to launch a larger propaganda campaign to peel ENOUGH people away from the boycott to dismiss the loss of a handful of customers. But especially because corporations aim to reach as wide an audience as possible, a handful of boycotters won’t make <del>a</del><ins>the</ins> difference. As it stopped neither *The Force Awakens* nor *Captain Marvel* from being mega hits. 

In fact, especially in the latter case, it can be argued that boycotts can risk the opposite effect happening. Why did *Captain Marvel* make so MUCH more money than <ins>say</ins> *Wonder Woman*, when there was nobody particularly boycotting DC’s effort? Boycotts call to attention that *somebody* wants this thing to fail. Which then pushes a lot of people who were on the fence about something, to support it out of spite. Not to mention the free publicity that comes from news coverage. 

And then, not only does the thing you wanted to fail do terribly well, but the creators get to feel confident in their invulnerability.

Yes, it really is THAT kind of playground politics. We really are just a bunch of 8th-graders, after all.

I’m no psychologist, but this does not seem like the mental profile of someone who will rationally adjust their thinking because the public spoke to her via the free market. The problem with the boycott is that it was *framed* by many as a direct *message* to *Rowling*. This resulted in a large number of people who either rationalized their pre-emptive support for the game cynically — by reasoning that it wouldn’t actually affect Rowling so it wouldn’t matter. Or people who felt that they could ‘offset’ their support for the game by donating to a “trans charity.” This isn’t the carbon footprint of morality.

The result of this boycott should have been to indicate a gesture of Trans solidarity. Not just SUPPORT, not throwing $60 at trans life line to make up for the $60 you spent at GameStop— solidarity. Because, let’s face it, the world doesn’t happen on Twitter and most people still don’t even really know that JK Rowling is a bigot, because their frame of reference is what the BBC says about her. So pledging NOT to buy the game would have been to a gesture to trans people to show who they can <del>or</del><ins>and</ins> cannot trust. 

There are hundreds of video games that come out every month — most of which are better than this one. You could demonstrate that respecting trans identities is more important than playing a video game. Instead, the drive for instant gratification to give your support a cheat day left<ins>...</ins> many trans people feeling voiceless and questioning their allies. If ever there was an ‘ask’ from trans people — for you to do *something* about how YOU live, rather than how you treat others… this was it. 

And in reality — THIS is what a successful boycott would have accomplished. It wouldn’t have bankrupted Rowling, it wouldn't have killed the *Harry Potter* brand, but it would have shown trans folks that the people in their lives care more about them than a <u>[silenced]</u> <s>fucking</s> video game.

And that is where we *should* have expectations for what <del>a</del><ins>this</ins> boycott — or any boycott — <del>should</del><ins>could</ins> accomplish. A judge of character, and often a very public one. But expecting this to do anything meaningful about de-platforming a bigot was unrealistic. 

So what do we do about HER, then?

We can do what we can to stop bigoted platforms from growing, but what do we do about this one particular lady? There is an option left, but it takes a lot more work than just tweeting about a video game, accidentally helping it to trend on Twitter. A lot more work. She needs to be made irrelevant. 

Now, she’ll always have clout as the creator of *Harry Potter*. There is no taking that away from her. But why does *Harry Potter* have to be something that can keep her relevant in a socio-political light Forever? Why can’t it just be another book series on the shelf? Or another bunch of movies people watch once <del>and</del><ins>in</ins> a while? Of course the best way to do this would be to lift up another author, preferably an out and proud queer author or at least a vocal ally, who is writing foundational literature for children and young adults.

<q>Foundational literature is a collection of books and stories that we read, or we are told as we grow up.</q> (I already made a video about this, but as Rowling’s been slipping deeper into alt-right rhetoric, I’ve adjusted my take<ins> a bit</ins>.) 

These are the stories that help you develop your sense of self, of right and wrong — these bits of media are part of the experiences which shape your fundamentally guiding values. This is why Children’s literature is so important, and why people fuss over Rhol<sup class="add">[sic: Roald]</sup> Dahl and Rojard Kipping<sup class="add">[sic: Rudyard Kipling]</sup>. For instance, the guy who coined the term: “white man’s burden” is *probably not someone* you should let into your kid<del>’</del>s<ins>'</ins> head<ins>s</ins>. 

These creators are literally there to help you instill morals into children's heads and futures. Typically, this type of literature is open minded, and welcoming to people who aren’t just like you. *Harry Potter* seemed to have that aspect, since mudbloods were heavily discriminated against, and even murdered, by the fascists of Rowling’s world. But even though they were a minority among wizards, good pure blood wizards still accepted them. And so we as children read that as <del>it</del> being important to accept people no matter their background. As long as they’re good people. We missed the stuff about Seamus and Cho Chang and The Goblins and such because we were kids.

But unlike a lot of foundational literature, which is usually focused on child readers, the *Harry Potter* books ostensibly grew up with us. The characters aged and developed, the themes became darker, and so… many of us never grew out of the books during publication. They followed us into adulthood. I personally had the perfect timing because the final book was released less than a month after I graduated from high school. So I was the perfect age to grow up with the books. Which is why I clung onto Hogwarts for deal life as a safe place for me for so long. So that’s the kind of foundational literature that we need to promote and get in<ins>to</ins> the hands of as many young readers as humanly possible. 

But it can’t be super disparate. Every kid can’t have their own series because then the societal connection doesn’t develop. They all need to go <del>to</del><ins>with</ins> the same book. Just like with *Harry Potter*. You know it's interesting how my generation grew up with *Harry Potter* and then came of age with *The Hunger Games* and now we’re a bunch of open minded, pretty accepting weirdos who want to eat the rich.

Anyway, can we do that? <u>[Takes sip of the drink poured at the start of the video.]</u> Can we force a single series of books to become a global sensation like that? Is there one already out there with one or two books, or has it yet to be written? 

And don’t tell me *Animorphs* or *Percy Jackson*. They’ve finished their run six times over by now so <del>there’s</del><ins>we're</ins> no<ins>t</ins> waiting two or three years to find out what happens next. This needs to be *new*. Something everyone can gather around and wait for midnight book launches. It needs to be like an HBO show only<ins>...</ins> for kids. 

It doesn’t have to SELL like Harry Potter, and it can even be something like a TV show, if any network would let a show go past three or four seasons these days. The important part is that the youthful characters need to grow up with their audience. *Stranger Things* kind of fit<ins>s</ins> the bill, to be honest, but I think it starts off too dark to get pre-teens on board. Or at least for their parents to let them watch it. But that just shows that it's possible. Replace *Harry Potter*’s social importance with something else.

But the other way to make her more or less irrelevant to the wider discussion is something we have no control over. But profit-driven movie executives do. In 1998 Warner Bros purchased the film rights to the *Harry Potter* books, and today they even share ownership of <del>the</del> “JK Rowling’s Wizarding World” as a whole brand. If you’ve been following <ins>the</ins> entertainment industry news the last few years, you’ll know Warner Bros has been past<sup class="add">[sic: passed]</sup> around like a party bottom<del>s</del> in Hollywood. First Time Warner owned them, then AT&T owned them, Now Discovery owns them, and according to people in the know, Discovery plans on selling Warner Bros to Universal Pictures in 2024. Which is why Warner Bros has been such a *mess* lately. They haven't had <ins>a</ins> solid leadership for over a decade. 

So in 2024 when Universal buys Warner Bros, they’re also buying their stake in The Wizarding World. They’ve seen what’s happened to ticket sales for Wizarding World movies since Joanne went full TERF, so it's easy to see that her connection with the franchise is an Albatross around its neck. So they could offer to buy the franchise from her wholesale.

Now the *evaluated worth* of the Harry Potter brand is about 26 billion dollars. That includes potential income from the brand in the future though, assuming Rowling’s presence won’t hurt the brand. Remember, Avalanche went *out of their way* to say that she had nothing to do with *Hogwarts Legacy*, which has been how many people defended their purchase of the game. The last release she was directly attached to <ins>was</ins> the *The Secrets of Dumbledore* movie, which bombed ***so badly*** <ins>that</ins> it convinced Warner Bros to kill the franchise right there <ins>and then</ins>, even though they’d signed <del>a deal</del><ins>deals with actors</ins> for seven movies. That’s just how much money they lost on <del>that</del><ins>the</ins> thing.

I think Universal plans on buying out the brand. They will be buying Warner’s stake in it, so there’s already a discount. Universal <del>also</del> stands to lose a lot of money if Rowling goes too far off the deep end for mainstream audiences to come up with excuses anymore. So buying her out would be a smart move. And they <del>wouldn’t</del><ins>absolutely would not</ins> even be paying <ins>the</ins> full price because a lot of the worth of the franchise is tied up in publishing deals, toy deals, apparel, Universal’s own Wizarding World park. And <ins>so</ins> as long as they continue the ongoing contracts, they wouldn’t need to buy them out, so they’d get it for much much less than 26 billion. 

Jesus. <mark fc>26 billion <ins>dollars</ins> is like… a theoretical number for me and someone has it on their bank balance.</mark> <u>[Takes sip.]</u> Eat the rich, kids.

No one has 26 billion dollars literally just sitting in their bank. Not how it works.

<ins>So</ins> There are two ways of take social power from her. We’ll never take her money away. She’ll never be *not rich,* but <ins>if</ins> we can make it that her opinions don’t really *matter* anymore. If she’s just some rich person living in a *castle* of all things, who the hell cares what she thinks? 

TERFS will, of course, and they’ll still flock to her like some cult leader, but if she no longer owns *Harry Potter*, or *Harry Potter* <del>is</del> no longer <ins>is</ins> relevant because another formative piece of literature has superseded it, then mainstream people will kind of forget that she exists. They have short memories, those people who live lives and do things other than live on Twitter.

Now we can’t influence Universal buying the franchise. But we CAN do option #1. We CAN push another piece of media to the prominence required to overtake Harry Potter. It can be a movie series, or a tv series, but its<sup class="add">[sic: it's]</sup> *best* if its<sup class="add">[sic: it's]</sup> a book series. They tend to have more longevity. And People connect more with books because they can imagine the world in their own head instead of just seeing what a director, cinematographer, and set designer want<ins>s</ins> them to see.

We can reduce her influence on the world. Where once she spoke out loudly in favor of social justice, she now works with people fighting hard to condemn some of the most endangered people among us. People who might be risking their lives just by leaving their house, she and her friends target them. She has become the exact kind of villainous bully we spent our childhoods reading her heroes triumph over. 

She was to be remembered as the woman who made a generation of kids want to read. Who told movie goers and readers around the world that accepting people for being different amounts to being a good person. She created a world in which everyone felt safe. No matter your race, or skin color, or religious belief, or your gender, or who you love<del>d</del>. She had created a legacy of not just *tolerance*, but acceptance.

But now she’s tarnished it in the minds of millions. And as long as she controls it, Hogwarts won’t feel safe for those people anymore. And she did that. With her ignorance, intolerance, and belligerent rhetoric, she<del>’s</del><ins> has</ins> made Hogwarts unsafe. 

And now *that’s* the real *Hogwarts Legacy*.
