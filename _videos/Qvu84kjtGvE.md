On November 8, 2018, Disney's CEO Bob Iger announced Disney's latest world conquering venture, Disney Plus. A digital streaming service, dubbed a "Netflix killer" by many in the media, that would make almost all of Disney's content streamable in one place. 

<u>[The DVD cover of *Song of the South* appears.]</u> Not you, we don't talk about you!

Big draws to the service were announcements of original series focusing on Disney's Marvel and Star Wars brands, with *Falcon and the Winter Soldier*, *WandaVision*, *Loki*, and *The Mandalorian* being revealed, though only *The Mandalorian* had a planned release date anytime soon. Alongside the Disney owned brands would live content from companies the mouse had recently acquired, namely 20th Century Fox. The fraught buyout of Fox had played out in entertainment reporting for months with most of the Internet being in favor of the potential ever growing monopoly, since it would mean Marvel's X-Men and Fantastic 4 would be under the watchful eye of Kevin Feige at Disney.

But along with the mutants, Disney acquired *hundreds* of other properties from Fox including, *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, which they've duly ignored ever since, and the film rights to the novel *Simon vs. the Homo Sapien<sup class="add">[sic: Sapiens]</sup> Agenda* by Becky Albertali, a young adult novel about a teenage gay romance that had been adapted into a hit film earlier that year. Unlike *Rocky Horror*, Disney saw potential with *Love, Simon*'s family-friendly representation of gay teens and announced a sequel streaming series as one of its main hooks to Disney Plus.

You see, Disney fully intended their streaming service to compete with Netflix, the dominant force in the streaming game, since it became a thing, and something Netflix had become well known for was their LGBT inclusive content. Whether it was original shows like *Orange is the New Black* *Sense8*, *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*, and *Grace and Frankie*, or their *extensive* library of queer films, Netflix had pretty much cornered the LGBT streaming market. And Disney wanted a piece of it. According to *The Hollywood Reporter*, Disney has a massive amount of data pointing toward them being *incredibly* popular among the LGBT community.<sup cn></sup> And so, they wanted to play into that by creating *Love, Victor*. 

</james>
<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The company pushed Disney Plus's annual subscription early on, locking audiences into a full year's worth of membership before the vast majority of their original content had even begun production, and one of its big selling points was the diversity representation of *Love, Victor*. According to market research, approximately 3.5 *million* initial subscribers to Disney Plus were LGBT.<sup cn></sup> Obviously, *Love, Victor* wasn't the sole reason reason for these people subscribing, but I'm willing to bet that it certainly helped boost those numbers.

</james>

Disney Plus went live in November of 2019, with *The Mandalorian* being their only major draw. Casting and production news surrounding *Love, Victor* had regularly trended on social media, and the upcoming series was considered Disney's next safe bet after *The Mandalorian* ran its course. 

But then, in February of 2020, things changed. Disney announced that love Victor would not be appearing on Disney Plus, despite selling people on it from the very beginning. Instead, it would stream on the also Disney-owned Hulu, a service with half as many subscribers, and one not available almost anywhere outside the United States. Their reasoning? *Deadline* reported that executives at Disney thought *Love, Victor* wasn't family friendly enough for the brand. I wonder what wasn't family friendly enough about it...?

Small note that in February 2020, [Disney Plus](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-worldwide-1234925654/) and [Hulu](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258014/number-of-hulus-paying-subscribers/) had similar numbers of subscribers, though by Fall 2020 Disney Plus did have about twice as many subscribers.

James seems to be referring to [this](https://deadline.com/2020/02/love-simon-spinoff-series-love-victor-moves-from-disney-to-hulu-premiere-date-opens-season-2-writers-room-1202866549/) article, though he never shows it.

One needs to ask, what would it have meant for a generation of queer kids to see a show representing them on a *Disney* platform? You don't get much more mainstream than Disney. That might have given hope to queer kids who are held down by their homophobic or transphobic families or communities. And while many queer youth avoided *Love, Simon* in theaters for fear of being spotted seeing a gay movie,<sup cn></sup> this TV sequel could have allowed them to take in a cute gay teen comedy from the comfort of their own laptop or phone. A possibility made all the more likely with how popular *Love, Simon* has been on streaming.

With Disney Plus in almost 50 million households by the time *Love, Victor* was released this June, that would have been a gigantic potential audience. But Hulu isn't in as nearly many homes. It isn't nearly as mainstream. Disney had the opportunity to say to those gay kids, "your stories are as good as anyone else's," but now, by shafting it over to Hulu, the Mouse has unequivocably<sup class="add">[sic: unequivocally]</sup> said, "you don't belong here."

<mark fc=false>According to Hulu, *Love, Victor* was its most binged show of 2020,</mark> which is pretty impressive considering how we've all been locked up with little more to do than stream TV shows. So not only did Disney segregate the queer audience to a smaller platform, but it missed out on a hit series, something the service is in desperate need of, with data showing that aside from *The Mandalorian*, none of Disney Plus's original content has been a hit.

No, it was ["the most-binged original drama series on Hulu in 2020 during its first week and the second most-binged original on Hulu placing behind *Solar Opposites*."](https://www.eonline.com/news/1166338/turns-out-love-victor-felt-quite-a-bit-of-viewer-love-on-hulu) This video was released in September 2020, you wouldn't be able to say anything definitive about the most-binged shows over the entire year anyway.

When Disney made the announcement that *Love, Victor* was being sent to Hulu, I was... frustrated, but not shocked. I was frustrated that even in 2020, queer people aren't considered family friendly enough for Disney. But I wasn't shocked... because Disney has an out-and-proud history of using and abusing the LGBT community for its own means. In order to talk about *that*, we'll need to discuss Disney's prolific history of queer coding villains, straight-washing heroes, and pandering to the LGBT community just to ignore us once they have our money.

Gay culture has always held the Disney oeuvre in high regard, but why exactly? To say that Disney was queer coding in the early days would be a bit disingenuous. I hardly believe that good ol' Uncle Walt, hater of all things subversive, would insert queer coded messages into his early
animated films, although six hairy men in one twink living together is a bit suspect. But queer readings of Disney films *are* possible and quite well known. Really, it all comes down to fantasy.

<mark>Although not necessarily evoking a world of gender fluidity, fantasy is often described as a method of escape from the trials and tribulations of everyday reality. Living in a society that has outlawed homosexual desire, categorized it as a medical disease, labeled it as a sin against God and allowed (and often encouraged) violent acts against LGBT people, queer culture has unsurprisingly embraced the potential for escape that fantasy and fairy tales provide. Heroes or heroines rise above their stations -rewarded for all their hardship and vilification by finding Prince Charming and/or being crowned as royalty. Others leave their drab and shabby existence and find a fascinating other world in which anything is possible. This second scenario is the basis for one of the key texts of queer culture, the film version of *The Wizard of Oz* from 1939. In the narrative, an underappreciated adolescent girl in the barren Midwest is whisked away to a fabulous land filled with color and spectacle where she finds friends who value her more than her biological family seems to.</mark>

Funnily enough, Walt Disney fought hard to get the film rights to *The Wizard of Oz* but failed. He would rarely let the rights to something he wanted slip through his fingers ever again.

I found this claim on a fandom site and a blog site and tracked it down to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oz_the_Great_and_Powerful#cite_ref-19). I looked at the citation for the Wikipedia claim, which is [a documentary on the making of *The Wizard of Oz*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4UYr2ON5SM) The narrator, Angela Lansbury, says that the production of the movie was influenced by the success of Disney's *Snow White* and that MGM bought the rights in 1938, but there's no mention of Disney trying to buy the rights at that time, though Disney would buy the rights to the rest of Baum's *Oz* books in the 50s and make several adaptations over the years.

<mark>Another narrative strand in Disney's films that would have a great appeal to the queer community is the tale of the outsider. Throughout the studio's history, Disney has consistently returned to the stories about characters who don't "fit in" to society. Unlike the heroines of L. Frank Baum's *Oz*, these characters do not find another world to escape to and must confront their ostracization. Rebuffed by the gatekeepers of what is normal and decent, these rejects eventually find acceptance and happiness by discovering a use for those aspects of themselves that were originally thought to be deficient or abnormal. Hans Christian Anderson, now recognized as gay himself, provided what is probably the archetypal version of the story, "The Ugly Duckling," which was adapted by Disney twice - in 1930 and again in 1939. </mark>

<mark>There are two early Disney shorts about outsiders, though, that are more easily read as specifically gay texts and delightfully affirming of otherness. The first of these is the Oscar-winning short *Ferdinand the Bull* from 1937.</mark> <mark>The cartoon tells the story of a young bull who is content to spend his life "just sitting quietly and smelling the flowers" rather than going after other more conventionally masculine pursuits. While Ferdinand has never shown having romantic interest in another bull, the character's quiet affection for flowers associates him with images of gay men in American culture at the time. You see, in the 1920s and 30s, gay men were frequently referred to as "pansies" or "buttercups." </mark>

<mark>Interestingly the short never seems to suggest that Ferdinand is somehow depraved or deserving of contempt for his desires. Although his mother wants to know why he doesn't want to run and leap and butt heads like the other young bulls, she accepts her son's lifestyle without much second thought. Ferdinand is never shown racked with guilt over his implied homosexuality or worried about what others may think of him. On the contrary, the cartoon continually shows close-ups of him batting his long eyelashes and sighing slowly and contentedly. Neither the narrator nor the visual design of the film ever judge Ferdinand as somehow wrong. Rather, there's a bemused acceptance of Ferdinand's attitude.</mark>

Michael Bronski sees such a double reading in J.M. Barrie's *Peter Pan*. While conventionally thought of as a children's story, Bronski describes it as, "a deeply disturbing meditation on the impossible desire for flight, not so much a fantasy of escape as it is a clear eyed exposure of escape's impossibility." The original 1904 play ends with Peter alone, and Barrie adds to the stage directions, </mark>

In this way identification and distanciation may occur simultaneously.”</mark><sup>47</sup> <mark>In regards to lesbian/gay use of fantasy, an irony exists — a simultaneous indulgence in and distancing from the work being engaged — which is far more developed than the normal child’s response. A lesbian/gay individual can sit through *Snow White* and dream of being taken away from a drab life to a castle on a hill, but s/he can also enjoy the absurdity of Snow White’s grotesquely warbling contralto. Michael Bronski sees such a double reading in Barrie’s *Peter Pan*. While conventionally thought of as a children’s story, Bronski describes it as “a deeply disturbing meditation on the impossible desire for flight . . . not so much a fantasy of escape as it is a clear-eyed exposure of escape’s impossibility.”<sup>48</sup> The original 1904 play ends with Peter alone, and Barrie adds in the stage directions,</mark> <mark>“It has something to do with the riddle of his being. If he could get the hang of the thing his cry might become ‘To live would be an awfully big adventure!’ but he can never quite get the hang of it, and so no one is as gay as he.”</mark><sup>49</sup>

<mark>The fascination that many gay men have with Disney villains is precisely over how they theatrically perform their gender roles, to the point where the "naturalness" of their gender can be called into question, Although the vengeful Queen in *Snow White* and the evil sorceress Maleficent in *Sleeping Beauty* are obstensibly gendered female, they both wear clothing that completely covers almost every inch of their bodies, including cowls or hoods that cover their heads. Only their hands and face are exposed, leaving the rest of the body cloaked. Their faces both have highly defined features (etched cheekbones, thin sharp noses strongly set jaws) in contrast to the softer designs of the heroines, and they also seem to have access to makeup, especially mascara and eyeshadow.

As described in chapter 1, Disney’s films increasingly emphasized heterosexual courtship as the studio moved more heavily into narrative and character animation. Fairy tales like “Snow White,” “Cinderella" and “Sleeping Beauty” lent themselves quite easily to this celebration and promotion of heterosexuality. Consequently, on a more basic level, gay culture’s appreciation of Disney villains is a humorous cheering on of those forces within the narrative that disrupt and frustrate heterosexuality’s dominance. <mark>*Sleeping Beauty*’s Maleficent actively works to spoil two generations of heterosexual coupling.

Cruella is also a single woman who has a fascination with Anita. They were friends in the past, or at least Cruella believed them to be friends, but they seem to have had a falling out, or at least a distancing when Anita went and found herself a man. A man Cruella truly loathes. One could argue that her desire for a Dalmation spotted coat doesn't really arrive until she comes to the conclusion that Anita will likely not be in her life anymore. Something to remember her by, or a way of punishing her? This is barely subtext of course, and I wouldn't claim that the writers intended a lesbian reading of the two women, but it's easy enough to superimpose such context on top of the more blatant messaging of the film.

I know this sounds extreme, and God knows it is, but that wasn't an uncommon opinion of families in the 50s and 60s.

You could come up with an excuse for *him* not having met the right girl yet, you could hide it. But a daughter, single, at 30?

13. Disney cynically exploited Howard Ashman's death

Okay, the best source I could find about Disney's relationship with Howard Ashman was the book *Disney War* and here's what it says: 

First, about Howard Ashman's open gayness being a problem for Disney, the book points in the opposite direction. It says that when Disney recruited Ashman, he asked them if his sexuality was gonna be an issue, and he was assured that it would not be. And when he later revealed his AIDS diagnosis to Eisner and Katzenberg and animation head Peter Schneider, they were all very supportive. 

Second, this supposed donation to the AID for AIDS Foundation, there's just nothing. I've looked and looked and found no connection between Disney and this charity, or any other shocking revelations about their Oscar campaign. There's just *no* publicity for this supposed publicity stunt. Disney *did* make a charity album for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation in 1991, but uh, it had no connection to the Oscars. They auctioned off some *Beauty in the Beast* art for the Gay Men's Health Crisis in 1992, but that would have been *after* the Oscars. The only connection I could find between Disney and AID for AIDS was the Disney Gay Night event I mentioned previously. And again, that was *not* connected to the Disney corporation.

And as for them being upset about Ashman's partner accepting his Oscar, according to *Disney War* Katzenberg arranged that *personally*. If any other executives felt differently about it, *please* tell me where you found this information. But I don't understand why they'd make pandering donations to gays and then not be okay with a gay man on stage. Are they pandering to gays or not?

James' own source, *Tinker Belles and Evil Queens*, provides additional evidence for the fact that Katzenberg was well-supported, at least by Katzenberg. It mentions that Katzenberg and Ashman had a close relationship several times (108, 192), and Katzenberg is said to have been involved with AIDS charities (110). Katzenberg called Ashman a "guardian angel" alongside Walt Disney, and there was a tribute to Ashman at the end of *Beauty and the Beast* (144). Also, [a Washington Post article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220422110450/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/22/lbgtq-audiences-artists-helped-save-disney/) claims that Disney even built a production unit near his house so that he could keep getting his treatments nearby.

Disney's animosity toward the queer community wasn't just all behind the scenes, though. It still managed to make it onto the big screen, beginning immediately with the first film of the Disney Renaissance, *The Little Mermaid*. The film's source material was obviously written by noted gay writer Hans Christian Anderson, so there's an immediate queer reading of the text available, but Disney went further than that by carrying on their tradition of having an older female villain who is predatory toward a young girl. But to add a special twist, Ursula was actually modeled after drag legend Divine. Though despite rumors, Disney never entertained the thought of offering the part to Divine and always intended on casting a female voice talent. Recent calls for the live action Ursula to be played by a drag queen were roundly ignored.

Disney also never intended Ursula to sing in the film.<sup cn></sup> <mark>But Howard Ashman thought otherwise, forcing Disney to accept the now iconic villain song "Poor Unfortunate Souls." In the number, Ursula uses various methods to convince Ariel to sell her soul, from looking sorry and saintlike to shimmying madly in excitement. In its use of vocalist Pat Carroll's ability to slide up and down the musical register, from shrieks to baritones, "Poor Unfortunate Souls" is an unmistakable sendup of the campy female impersonation numbers</mark> of underground queer films in the early days of Hollywood. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.tinker_belles at="p.146-147"%}>

Again, how much of this is due to Ashman needs to be placed in context with others working on the films. For example, Andreas Deja obviously did his share in adding to the camp value of these projects. Ashman himself probably had little say in the model sheet for Ursula. Yet, her campy nature is due at least in part to the words that Ashman gives her to perform. In *The Little Mermaid*, <mark>Ashman provided Ursula with a solo number, “Poor Unfortunate Souls.”<sup>37</sup> In the number, Ursula uses various methods to convince Ariel the mermaid to sell her soul — from looking penitent and saintlike to shimmying madly in excitement. “In its use of vocalist Pat Carroll’s ability to slide up and down the musical register, from shrieks to baritones, ‘Poor Unfortunate Souls’ is an unmistakable sendup of the campy female impersonation number.”</mark><sup>38</sup> Similarly, although Deja must share credit, Ashman not only helped conceive Gaston in *Beauty and the Beast* but emphasizes his campiness through the lyrics of *his* solo number, “Gaston,” a hysterical “*male* impersonation” number! As was discussed in chapter 2, the tradition of reading Disney villains as “gay-tinged” reaches much farther back than Ashman’s involvement with the studio. Ashman’s creation of musical numbers for the villains, though, underlines this position, allowing mainstream audiences and reviewers to positively revel in the campiness of their villainy.

I was shocked to learn that a queer reading of *Beauty and the Beast* was actually pretty well documented in popular culture at the time of its release. Not just comparing Gaston to the gay muscle queens that had become so well known in large urban centers, mostly because it was believed that high muscle mass would help you fight off the effects of HIV,<sup cn></sup> <mark>but the Beast himself became an AIDS allegory in the mainstream press, with Dan Rather writing an article in the LA Times that read,</mark>

The Beast is definitely an angry creature, and his initial attempts to woo Belle are blatant bargaining, done simply to remove the curse without necessarily feeling any actual love towards her. When he allows Belle to leave his domain, he enters a state of depression that makes him unwilling to defend himself against the mob that arrives to string him up. Most touchingly, the Beast reaches acceptance just at the moment of his seeming death. As a soft rain falls around them, Belle caresses the dying Beast, and the Beast ventures that “Maybe it’s better this way.” Belle protests, but the Beast looks up at her with love, touches her face as he says “At least I got to see you one last time” and then lapses into unconsciousness. (Of course, the tale resurrects the Beast and cures the spell when she says “I love you” just as he seems to expire.)

For example, one particularly colorful panel commemorating an adult male depicts an underwater scene and contains a number of lines from songs written for *The Little Mermaid* (1989), the animated musical Disney made just before *Beauty and the Beast*. Amongst these are such quotes as “The men up there don’t like a lot of blather,” and “Don’t forget the importance of body language.” The attention paid by television and print news to the displays of the AIDS Quilt might have made some, like Rather, more aware of the im- portance of Disney in these people’s lives, thus making it easier to understand the 1991 film as an AIDS allegory.

For the record, the bulk of this Disney video (I'd say about two thirds of it) is sourced from *Tinker Belles and Evil Queens* by Sean Griffin, so this is another one where you can just easily compare Somerton's video to the book and see what details he's added.

<mark>With Ashman's involvement in *Aladdin* being cut short by his death, certain concepts he held for the project ended up dropped or modified by the studio. One major change was the elimination of the character of Aladdin's mother, for whom Ashman had written the song, "Proud of Your Boy," declaring her love for her son no matter how he lives his life. This ode to maternal love attempted to tell Aladdin not to be ashamed of himself or want to be someone else just to make people accept him. Its message isn't exactly subtle,</mark> so of course Disney cut it. <mark>Although Aladdin became an orphan in the final version of the film</mark> (would it be a Disney movie if there weren't orphans), <mark>his self-hatred and desire to become someone else still figure strongly into the narrative.

Some producers of *Aladdin*<sup>who?</sup> have claimed the queer coding in the film was entirely accidental, and in fact it's so subtle that a lot of people don't pick it up. But with Ashman's involvement writing the songs and helping to develop the story after being diagnosed with AIDS, knowing it might be his last project, I'm willing to bet that the coding is there on purpose.

In Disney's next animated feature, we wouldn't get a sea drag queen, an AIDS allegory, or a campy Genie. Instead, we got accidental gay parents and yet another queer coded villain. But before then, Disney accidentally produced an iconic entry into the queer cinematic canon with *Hocus Pocus*. No gay coding here, though I always hoped Thackery Binks was gay, just three campy witches that would go on to inspire generations upon generations of drag queens. 

Now... to the lions. Though we may not remember it, *The Lion King* was pretty controversial upon release. Disney's return to the main stage of animation in the early 90s with *The Little Mermaid* had pissed off a *lot* of feminists, who were aghast that Disney made a movie in which the female lead literally has her voice stolen from her. <mark>To fix this, they made Belle a very proactive, intelligent character in *Beauty and the Beast*.</mark> Then they received a huge amount of backlash from Arab Americans after the release of *Aladdin* for some... <u>[On screen, lyrics to "Arabian Nights" are shown: "Where they cut off your ear / If they don't like your face / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."]</u> ... less than sensitive lyrical choices, and having an all-white voice cast.

<mark>The studio attempted to respond to these complaints when working on the character Belle in *Beauty and the Beast*, taking care to show her intelligence and independence,</mark> although the narrative still focuses on which man she will marry.

<comment>

This is, roughly, a paraphrase of p.207-210 of Griffin, combined with general pop culture knowledge. Some additional context: Disney actually hired a woman screenwriter, Linda Woolverton, for *Beauty and the Beast*, (likely) in response to the feminist critiques of *The Little Mermaid* (143, 207, 210), rising from Ariel's dependence on male characters (the book does not mention this commonly-cited "pop culture" feminist critique regarding Ariel's voice.) Still, he notes, "The variety of reaction from women when the film was released points out that many of the problems women found in *The Little Mermaid* were not solved. Consequently, while many gay men responded warmly to Beauty and the Beast, many lesbians might have had a hard time finding anything they could take from a film in which the female lead’s only duty is to choose whether she will marry an egotistical macho jerk or a male behemoth." (207-208) As for the criticisms by Arab Americans, I didn't see a criticism of the voice cast mentioned in the book, and the lyric criticisms were part of a larger criticism of how Arab culture is portrayed in *Aladdin* (which is to say, in a very sterotypical, orientalist way that does not at all match reality.)

The most obvious gay figure in the film is the villainous lion Scar, voiced by Jeremy Irons, who archly portrays a physically weak male who makes up for his lack of sheer strength with catty remarks and invidious plotting. Animated by Deja, the character fairly swishes, disdaining the concept of the heterosexual family in his attempt to usurp the throne for himself. When Scar refers to the cub prince Simba as a “hairball,” Mufasa (Simba’s father and king) warns “That ‘hairball’ is my son and your future king.” Scar dons a mockingly prissy gracious- ness as he responds snidely, “Oh! I shall practice my curtsy!” Later, when Simba laughs and tells Scar, “You’re so weird,” the bored villain stares him straight in the eye and intones, “You have *no* idea . . .”

Disney’s relationship with the gay community often mirrors this pattern. Deja, in his studio-sanctioned interviews, makes certain to as- sert that the work of the homoerotic artist Tom of Finland had no inﬂuence on his drawing of *Beauty and the Beast*’s beefy Gaston.48 In the interviews with Deja conducted just before the release of *Aladdin*, he is questioned about some of the jokes in the ﬁlm, such as the “Genie-as-prissy-tailor” scene.

Further, the network seemed to be antagonistic towards anyone else making a proﬁt off lesbianism with Ellen, since the network not only turned down an ad by the HRC but also one by Olivia Cruises, a vacation company aimed at lesbians.

5. Disney did a gay charity event and stole the profits.

Okay, this *is* a thing that happened, but it wasn't Disney. Disney Gay Days was an informal, unsanctioned event organized by an outside travel agency. They had *no* official connections to the actual park. It was discovered that the agency wasn't giving the profits to charity like they promised, and after that they went out of business. This had nothing to do with the actual Disney corporation.

The history of Gay Nights are detailed in Griffin's book as well. "In the 1990s, the Odyssey Tours travel agency began renting out the park one night a year (usually during the early winter, traditionally a slow period for the park) to hold “Gay Nights” at the park. Although never specifically advertised with such a phrase, the flyers and print ads announced that portions of the proceeds would go to the Aid for AIDS charity, and, judging by the crowds these nights attracted, most people 'got the hint.' (191) "In 1995, the lesbian and gay circles of Southern California by and large turned away from the annual 'Gay Night' at Disneyland. While not a systemized boycott, word spread throughout the area that Odyssey Tours, who organized the event, was making only token donations of the proceeds to the Aid for AIDS charity — even though the publicity prominently described itself as a charity event. Conceiving of the 'Gay Night' as a 'con job' on lesbian and gay customers, attendance dropped precipitously." (203) There were various boycots and other protests by Christian fundamentalists and the like from the mid 1990s onward, but none of them had to do with Gay Nights.

<mark>Disney's *Mulan* is, however unintentionally, a queer narrative that explores both gender identity and sexual orientation.

<mark>Disney’s "Mulan" is, however unintentionally, a queer narrative that explores both gender identity and sexual orientation. It is not, as it is often simplistically described, a story about a disempowered woman who becomes empowered by masculinity. It is a story about a young person who doesn’t fit the rigid constructs of womanhood or manhood, and who must instead carve her own path. </mark>

<mark>Mulan’s gender journey over the course of the movie feels very familiar to me as a nonbinary trans person. First, in "[Honor to Us All(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnUEDaeoF0Q)]," the village women attempt to sculpt Mulan into an ideal woman — and more specifically, an ideal wife.</mark> It surprises some of my friends that this has always been my favorite scene in the movie, and that as a child, I longed to dress as Mulan in full bridal garb for Halloween. But this actually fits my experience navigating gender: I was a child who was excellent at embodying girlhood and wanted badly to become a beautiful, graceful, feminine woman… but it just wasn’t in the cards for me. <mark>Mulan, too, fails the test of womanhood when her meeting with the Matchmaker goes horribly awry. As Mulan acknowledges this failure in "Reflection," she poses a question that most trans people know intimately: "When will my reflection show who I am inside?"</mark> And what exactly would that reflection be? If Mulan isn’t a woman, then who (or what) is she?

When I was at Smith College and coming into my own gender revolution, I thought, "I’m pretty sure I’m not a cis woman, so maybe I’m a trans man." I started binding my chest and wearing Oxford collar shirts and sweater vests (it was New England, so I thought I looked cool). I kept a secret Tumblr blog under a male alter-ego named Levitt, for Joseph Gordon-Levitt — which is very embarrassing to admit now. At that birthday party, <mark>I saw this version of myself in Mulan, as she prepares to convince everyone she’s a man — practicing her swagger, affecting her voice to a lower register, and scrambling to settle on a "boy name." In "[I’ll Make A Man Out of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9MfuWSQoWc)," Mulan-as-Ping progressively works her way toward achieving manhood, which is defined by catching fish, carrying heavy things, and, of course, wielding a big stick. She later fails the test of manhood when she is revealed as a woman — or, rather, as someone who is not a man. Ultimately, Mulan is able to defeat the bad guys by playing on their misperceptions of her gender,</mark> and — in an unfortunately transmisogynistic scene — getting her friends to transgress gender, as well. <mark>Through a queer lens, the message of Disney’s "Mulan" is something I learned as I came into my nonbinary identity: By rejecting society’s limited ideals of "womanhood" and "manhood," you can become your most authentic self.</mark>

<mark>Then there’s Li Shang, the handsome young general who falls for both Ping and Mulan, and who has been meme-ified as a bisexual icon.</mark> Between the women in the rice paddy blushing and giggling as Mulan-as-Ping passes by, and Ping and Shang’s awkward flirtations, even the sexuality and romance in Disney’s "Mulan" is queer.

Because of all this, and because I’ve come to read Disney’s "Mulan" as a queer Asian American narrative, I feel apprehensive about the upcoming live action adaptation. With reports of major changes to the original — including a new villain, a new love interest, and no songs at all — it seems like the live action movie will be nothing less than a total departure from its animated original. This is a blow to anybody who loves the 1998 version, but especially to queer Asian Americans. Without Shang or the original soundtrack, there will likely be no bisexual love story or genderqueer introspection. Considering that 2015’s "Cinderella" and 2017’s "Beauty and the Beast," the only other live action Disney princess adaptations that have been released so far, both stay extremely faithful to the characters, songs, and even the shots of the animated originals, it feels particularly othering that Mulan — one of the only Disney "princesses" of color — is getting an extreme makeover.

Disney went into a prolonged slump with the birth of the New Millennium only the
Pirates of the Caribbean franchise seemed to be keeping the studio afloat and
even then when the first film was in production it was giving Executives heart
problems the dailies coming in of Johnny Depp playing Jack Sparrow as at least
questioningly queer put Michael Eisner under so much stress he literally had a
heart attack in an interview after the film's release Depp said it trickled back
to me that Michael Eisner went on some sort of bent about how godamn it Johnny
Depp's ruining the film what is that thing is it drunk is it gay what the [ __ ]
are you doing he'd asked when they asked me if if he was gay I said didn't you
know all my characters are gay I really expected to be fired but I wasn't for
some reason 

the film and its sequels went on to be big hits for the studio for
the most part the new blood of 1980s Disney had all left the company by the time
the Pirates sequel started coming out Jeffrey kenberg left the company to start
DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David geffin Michael Eisner stepped down in
a swirl of controversy and Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash in 2005 Bob
Iger took over the position of CEO at Disney the company was Under New
Management for the first time in 20 years Iger was well known in political
circles as a progressive on social issues and had spearheaded multiple
initiatives while working under Michael Eisner to increase the rights of LGBT
employees at Disney and to empower LGBT Disney fans under his stewardship Disney
switched from the once a year gay night at Disney parks to the full Gay Days
event rebranding the occasion into a more familyfriendly affair with the
intention of helping bring LGBT families into the mainstream he was vocally
opposed to George W Bush's crusade to ban gay marriage and donated to the Obama
for president campaign in 2008 under the caveat that Obama not defend the
defensive Marriage Act or don't ask don't tell if he were to make it into office
Obama agreed leading to both homophobic laws being overturned queer Disney
stands were excited for iger's takeover of the company having such a vocal
supporter of LGBT rights as the head of a company like Disney could only mean
good things when Iger went on a spending spree buying up properties such as
Marvel and Star Wars gay fans got excited to see if queer characters would make
their way into those franchises as we know from the last video they did not Iger
has been a benign CEO as far as LGBT representation goes while he hasn't allowed
major characters to come out as LGBT putting his foot down when Tao atiti
planned for valkyrie to be a lesbian and Thor Ragnarok he has allowed smaller
queer characters to appear such as the lodge owners in Frozen lefu in the Beauty
and the Beast remake Spectre in onward and a quick lesbian kiss in Star Wars
Episode 9 one could argue that he could have been vetoing all LGBT
representation like Disney CEOs before him that he could be actively opposing us
but I say that's a pretty pathetically low bar Disney is the preeminent media
provider right now with Pixar Star Wars Marvel Fox and their own original
properties it could be argued that they're growing a media Monopoly when I've
contributed to myself I was one of the people arguing for Disney to buy up Fox
so that we could finally get some good X-Men and Fantastic 4 movies that weren't
Logan also that they buy up Sony Pictures so that Spider-Man can stay in the MCU
but now that Disney does own Fox I have to wonder when they make their X-Men
movie will Iceman be straight again he came out of the closet in the comics a
few years ago with a really touching storyline will Disney do away with that for
a liveaction ican or will they simply keep him on the bench so they don't have
to deal with it at all now that Disney owns The Rocky Horror Picture Show what
will become of that will it continue to run as a midnight movie event or will
Disney pull the film home prints that are in circulation they're certainly
controlling over their copyrighted content so I can imagine they wouldn't be too
pleased with theaters showing the film without their say so an odd Ray of Hope
in Disney them is Kevin feige The Mastermind behind the MCU he's threatened to
quit before not over pay raises but over control of characters Disney gave in to
his demands and only once has stepped into to override his decision that being
valkyrie's queerness even with their attempted straightwashing the coding is
still so obvious it can barely be called coding his contract is once again
coming up for Renewal and it looks like Valkyrie will indeed be looking for her
Queen in Thor love and thunder a lesbian lead character in a potentially billion
dooll movie will make Disney execs quake in their Gucci loafers but worrying
over that might be worth keeping the Golden Goose that is Kevin feige the Young
Avengers featuring Marvel's Premier gay couple Wiccan and hulkling is reportedly
in development either e as a Disney Plus show or as a feature film hulkling
being the king of space and Wiccan being the center point for all existence in
the Marvel Universe makes them pretty much the ultimate superhero power couple
and briee Larsson has been very blunt in her opinion the Captain Marvel should
have a girlfriend in her sequel while Tom Holland will use any opportunity to
let reporters know that he thinks his Spider-Man needs a boyfriend so is it
possible for Disney via Marvel Studios to become the main source for LGBT rep
representation in Hollywood all because of one producer they're terrified to
lose it's a distinct possibility though the gay representation in Avengers
endgame was much maligned by LGBT audiences it was an interesting experiment the
scene is small and easily removable but Marvel refused to cut it for the film's
release in countries like China Russia and places in the Middle East calling the
bluff of those countries sensorship guidelines and since theater owners didn't
want to lose out on a Marvel movie The Scene stayed in effectively a positive
test run to see if fogy and Marvel could indeed get away with having queer
characters in Marvel movies even in countries where homosexuality may be
punishable by death but Marvel is the outlier at Disney no producer at Disney
has the power and influence that Kevin feige does and even he hasn't managed to
have an out queer main character in a film yet though we're apparently getting
one with the eternals if that ever gets released the house of mouse continued
use though to profit from its LGBT fan base while starving us for representation
so that we'll be satisfied by the scraps they see fit to toss us a queer
ascended extra or a blinking you miss it moment does not make up for everything
Disney has done it's a well-known fact among industry professionals that Mulan
was altered so drastically from its original animated form specifically to
appeal to the Chinese box office which is why any hint at by or trans
representation has been removed from the film even the Cod in at least according
to the people I know who have seen the movie and their Jungle Cruise movie has
an implied gay character that the test audiences found so offensive that the
movie Saw massive delays in order to re-shoot Giant sections of the film at the
Disney parks it's not uncommon to see Rainbow lace Disney shirts hats Mickey
ears pins bracelets and notebooks all kinds of merchandise they're more than
willing to sell us all sorts of stuff except a ticket to a movie with actual
representation they will happily take our money and slightly wink when we ask if
Elsa is a lesbian they'll sell us a movie ticket and shrug who knows when we ask
if Po and Finn will kiss they'll sign you up for a Year's membership to Disney
plus and then move L Victor to Hulu Disney is a company like any other they go
where the prophets are and they are drawn to those profits like a sharked blood
the thing is the LGBT community has been feeding them with no demand for
something in return they queer B Stucky finp and Elsa we still give them our
money they make a huge deal out of an exclusively gay moment just to give us two
seconds of two men dancing and we still give them our money they remove even the
gay coding from their remakes and we still give them our money is Disney the
worst company in the world no of course not it's not like they're fracking when
people leave the parks I've loved Disney for as long as I can remember the first
movie I saw in theaters was Aladdin my first crushes were Aladdin and Hercules I
knew for sure that I was 100% gay because I saw Tarzan swinging around half
naked and thought yep that's what I want Disney isn't Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby
it's not a hateful company and it's not a company most people can easily drop
from their lives Disney is a part of the culture now hell they've created a big
chunk of the culture that we live in so I'm not saying you need to stop seeing
Disney movies but I do think we need to send Disney a very strong message either
give us representation or don't stop the baiting stop the May and the who knows
and the Som days and stop promising us representation and then taking it away
this video began as a quick angry rant after Disney tried blocking my last video
from going up but it evolved into something else entirely I started looking into
the history of queerness in Disney movies and found a lot more than I was
expecting I shouldn't be surprised because of course it's there there's
queerness everywhere because we are everywhere we're storytellers and Artists
Craftsmen and animators composers lyricists Executives and producers we help run
the Disney parks and we're in costume at those Parks so of course we've found
our way into the history of Disney as employees and fans we represent Disney
every single day and it's about damn time Disney start representing [Music] us
