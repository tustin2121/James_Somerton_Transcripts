This person has a nicer home, this person has a nicer car, that person has more followers, this person seems to look like Chris Evans in full Captain America mode every moment of every day. When the fact of the matter is that Chris Evans doesn't even like looking like Captain America. Part of the reason he was so vehement about his decision to not continue portraying the character was because of the *intense* demands on his body. 

(It's also part of the reason he'd request shirtless scenes in his movies - if he was going to suffer to look like that, he was gonna make sure that everyone could see it.)

In order to get his body in the kind of tip-top condition that made Hayley Atwell slip out of character for a minute, his daily routine was grueling, and his meal plan was bleak: low carb, heavy green vegetables, and meal supplements. And to boot, anytime you see his body, he dehydrated himself for *at least* forty-eight hours leading up to the shoot. 

People don't just *look* like that. It is a full-time job, not only to get into shape like that, but to keep yourself in shape like that. And given how imbalanced your nutritional intake needs to be, on top of intermittent dehydration, it's not healthy to sustain that kind of body type for very long. It's not possible to look like that all the time. And expecting someone to look like that at all is a little absurd. How much life do you miss out on by living at the gym that much?

As I've mentioned in previous videos, I came out pretty young. I was twelve when I first started telling people that I was gay because I was just too damn impatient to wait any longer. I wanted a boyfriend and I wanted one ASAP. 

Through my teen years, finding other gay people was near impossible, but when I did manage to find one, I always got the same response: "Ew, you're fat, go away." It was basically those words every time without variation. Sometimes it felt like they'd all gotten together and written a script... which didn't help my body issues at all.

You see, I was sent to a dietitian when I was seven years old. My doctors didn't think that my baby fat was coming off fast enough and wanted it under control. So I was put on a strict calorie-controlled diet that my parents, my friends' parents, and my extended family made sure I followed to a T. Later on, I was told that this kind of dieting at such a young age may have actually stunted my growth, since most of my male cousins are well over six feet tall. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}> 

But despite the diet, I continued to gain weight. The only explanation from the dietitian was that I must be cheating, or that my parents must be slipping me snacks. The blame was placed squarely on *actions*, not body chemistry. No tests were run to see if maybe I had a malfunctioning thyroid or anything like that. I was just *eating* too much, plain and simple. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}> 

Eventually, my mother stopped taking me to see the dietitian because I only left there feeling worse about myself every time. And as I grew into my teenage years, I continued to gain weight. On and on the pounds came, until I was well over three hundred pounds come high school graduation. I didn't start losing weight at all until I went on a crash diet during film school, since I could barely afford rent, let alone three square meals a day. I was only taking in about 400 calories, and even on that "stranded in the mountains about to start contemplating eating your friends" diet, I only lost about twenty pounds in six months. 

</james>
<from></from>

Obviously there was something wrong. Not only did I feel physically horrible since asthma plus excess weight *does not* equal a good time, but I felt emotionally horrible because I was now twenty-two, had been out for a decade and never had a real life boyfriend. 

I "dated" guys online but never showed them anything but my face. In the rare occasion that they'd see my midsection... six months of talking would go out the window as I got blocked. ...So I felt like garbage, and decided to find out what was wrong.

There had to be an imbalance somewhere in my body. So when I moved home after film school, I made my doctor send me for every test he could *think* of for any condition that could lead to weight gain or difficulty losing weight. Everything came back fine. I was perfectly healthy, except for the extra 120 pounds I was carrying around. 

</james>
<from></from>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}> 

So he sent me to a *new* dietitian, and three months later following her direct meal plans, I'd gained back the twenty pounds I'd lost in film school and then some. Again, I was told that I must be cheating and not following the plan. The plan was... white rice, steamed chicken with water or black coffee, with a multivitamin. 

My mom thought I was crazy for doing it, but I had never in my life been *thin*, not for one day. Even at birth I weighed more than average. And I would do *anything* to be able to try on a shirt in a store and not have to walk out of there feeling *horribly* embarrassed because the triple XL wouldn't button.

I spent another decade dieting, going to the gym regularly, counting calories and watching my weight fluctuate between sixty pounds past clinically defined morbid obesity and eighty pounds past clinically defined morbid obesity. 

A new doctor eventually put me on a weight loss medication, a daily injection which works by making you so sick to your stomach that you simply can't eat. I shot myself up every day for months, not taking in *nearly* enough food to be considered healthy. I tolerated the side effects like extreme nausea and constant shortness of breath, which was *actually* an allergic reaction to the shots, but I wasn't about to tell my doctor that because this was supposed to help me lose weight. 

This is just how toxic the need to lose weight is. I was willing to endure an allergic reaction to a *very* powerful drug just to try to lose weight. 

I lost those twenty pounds again, but that was it. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}> 

Finally I'd had enough. <u>[clears throat, suppressing emotion]</u> After my mom passed away, she left me a little money, so I was gonna take that plus my own meagre savings to have weight loss surgery. Specifically gastric sleeve surgery, a procedure in which they remove the majority of your stomach, shaping it into roughly the size and shape of a banana. Irreversible, and well known for complications like acid reflux so bad that you may need throat surgery within a few years. 

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}> 

But I was sick of being fat. I was sick of being ignored by every man I ever found attractive. I was sick of feeling like a charity case anytime anyone I knew said that I looked good. 

So I booked the surgery, paid the deposit, booked the flight (since the surgeon doing the surgery was halfway across the country), and started on the all liquid diet that leads up to the procedure. After all of that, I started to ask myself, "am I gonna go under the knife, get a surgery with potential lifelong complications, risk death on the operating table, for the approval of men who may very well be some of the biggest assholes in the world? Was I really doing this?" Did I think so little of *myself* that the opinions of headless torsos on Grindr could send me to a *surgeon* who would change the way my body worked *forever?* So I swallowed the cost of the deposit and I canceled the surgery.

Since then, I've been doing research into how this happened to us. How did our entire society become so obsessed with lean and toned or muscular bodies? It wasn't always this way.

Okay, so capitalism is a simple one. You can easily connect the dots to how generating a sense of culture that drives people to *desperately* conform to a body ideal can result in someone making a profit. But fascism? That's gonna take a little bit of explaining.

In the culture of today, I don't really like talking about fascism. I *have* to talk about it, however, because I'm learning that analyzing media in this day and age inevitably results in hosting a discussion about fascism. That's *just the culture we live in.* 

As a wise woman once said, "Thanks, I hate it."

I know "Thanks, I hate it." is a meme at this point, but I first heard it said by Lindsay Ellis. And given that James has said in the past that he was inspired to become a video essayist by Ellis, [I'm inclined to believe the "wise woman" he references is her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-pB1dqpF7Q).

<james {% include timecode %}> 

But one of the difficulties about talking about fascism and sorting media into categories of what does or does not support neo-fascist ideology, is that fascism itself is hard to describe. Because a definition of fascism does not really include the way that fascism is as much of a *process of government* as it is a method and a model. 

The history class description of fascism as "communism is the far left, and fascism is the far right," it's a little bit too simple.

</james>
<comment>
{% include header for=tobi %}

James says all this, but never actually bothers to give a definition for fascism, leading to him mistaking it for a number of other concepts, such as authoritarianism. He doesn't even try to take the definition from the university paper he's stealing from. For a good overview of what fascism actually is, see Innuendo Studio's [Endnote 2: White Fascism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng&pp=ygUXZW5kbm90ZSAyIHdoaXRlIGZhc2Npc20%3D).

We seem to treat fascism like an asymptote, where there's a point where a political group may throw out any number of fasc-y red flags, but it's impossible to collectively label them as fascist.

Culturally, we have decided that the Nazi party of Germany was fascist, which means that it doesn't matter how a political body may draw cues from the Third Reich, as long as it is not *the* Third Reich as it manifested from the late 1920s to early 1940s in Germany, it is not fascism. 

Using the Nazi party as the gold standard of evil has consequences like this. By treating them as this sacred measure of maximum evil, we have a standard by which, if something is not as bad as the Nazis, then it's fine, or at least tolerable. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james>

Or alternatively, when something *is* as bad as Nazis, it is taboo to acknowledge it, and for that reason we cannot discuss Rwanda, or Sarajevo, or any number of massacres that have happened in the last century because it makes us uncomfortable to think that the Nazis weren't just a one-off fluke of evil political evolution. <mark fc=false>Stalin, for instance, was responsible for far more ethnic cleansing than Hitler was.</mark>

Part of this is due to the fact that our functional definitions of fascism are rooted in anecdotal examples of where fascists appear, usually in retrospect.

A re-evaluation of fascism would require us to remove it as a method of government and more so focus on the ways that fascist governments enforce their ideology, and the kinds of values from which fascist ideologies emerge. So often, we are told *what* fascism is, *what* it looks like, *why* it begins, *why* it's bad. In our essentialist thinking, we look for those *specific* markers - the swastika armbands, the skull and crossbones, the Hugo Boss - and we don't take these markers and consider how they could be reapplied into a contemporary context.

To me, I think the what and why of fascism are less important to identify than the how... and the who. 

Who is fascism promoting as the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Who should the public idolize and how does the governing body enforce these values? But these are much more abstract and unquantifiable than listing a collective set of characteristics that manifest in fascist states, or how fascist states arise.

For instance, one of the more common assumptions about fascism is that it limits the public's freedom of speech. And that is true; the government wants to control how the public thinks, so they restrict what the public can say. It makes it more difficult to spread ideas that may not align with how the state wants the masses to think. 

And no, freedom of speech does not apply to being able to say whatever you want on social media. Just like a store manager can have you escorted off the premises for violating profanity guidelines, a private business can block what you can express on their social media platform. Freedom of speech simply means *the government* cannot persecute you for saying whatever you want about it with your mouth. It was designed to protect the press so that it could accurately report about the government.

In America, there are no *official* exemptions to freedom of speech, however in Canada, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms *also* include freedom of speech, but this freedom does not extend to hate speech that may target any particular ethnic, racial, religious or sexual minority. (At least in theory). 

By literal definition, this would mean Canada is more fascist than America in this regard. However, in practice, this is abundantly untrue.

There are plenty of exemptions to freedom of speech in the U.S., [including obscenity, libel, fraud, incitements to violence, "fighting words," and more.](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/unprotected-speech-synopsis). However, it is true that [Canada has restrictions on "hate speech"](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-319.html) while the U.S. does not (Matal v. Tam, 2017). 

Also, what "literal definition" is he talking about? He never gave one. In any case, a better word for the restriction of personal liberties would be "authoritarian". Though yes, colloquially, some people will (incorrectly) call any government control that they don't like "fascism."

And of course by removing fascism from its existing definition, we run the risk of *oversaturating* it to the rest of the world.

There are several patterns you see in fascism (when we decide to spot it). Rule of one figurehead, hero worship, master race, purging undesirables, etc, etc. We've been to this rodeo before. We talk about all of these things, all of the time. But if we're looking at patterns of how totalitarian regimes deploy fascism, there are some other weird patterns. 

There's usually a focus on art and ideals of beauty, and this is where we can arguably see fascism most clearly: when the state uses force and manipulation to consolidate the public interest around a single standard of beauty. This other major tenet to fascism is (and this was especially true for the Nazis) something we might today call body fascism, which is simply defined as &mdash;

This is present throughout all forms of fascism, but especially the ones based around the myths of Scandinavia. The Nordic Superman, the Aryan, the Ubermensch. Which is most of the fascism that has spurred on the men's rights groups around North America and Western Europe. Even though the vast, *vast* majority of them do not fit the description of what they would describe as the "ideal male body". 

Which, focusing so much on the ideal male body kind of sounds pretty gay to me if you ask me. Granted, the blonde-haired blue-eyed poster boy for Nazi propaganda befits even a contemporary model for desirability. "This could one day be you... or your son, or your nephew." The Nazi party very strongly associated itself and its success with physical beauty. 

So though the perfect male body has been an element of fascism from the very beginning, never was it more prevalent than in Nazi Germany. Because Hitler was obsessed with the art of classical Greece.

This was mostly because Nazi propaganda was facilitated on the myth of the Aryan race, and... that the Aryan race was inherently superior by genetic determination.

Leaning heavily into phrenology, the now debunked study of the various elements of how the skull was shaped being an indicator of personality traits, specifically intelligence.

Because your typical man wasn't working in labor jobs anymore, attaining strong muscles and ripped abs. Instead they were standing on production lines or sitting in offices, growing flabby.

(We didn't want to be Nazis, not necessarily. Well, we ignored the ones that did... Do...)

In the 1960s and 70s, you were far more likely to see gay men with defined abs and pecs than straight men. It was even considered a way for straight people to spot us. If a man at the beach looked like he lived at the gym, he was probably gay. Because not only were we trying to attain these bodies for ourselves, but the gym was a *great* place to find other people trying to attain those bodies. And a great place to hook up.

Straight men were actually warned away from going to gyms in major cities because you never know what might happen in the locker room.<sup cn></sup> Yeah, queers and locker rooms have been a straight scare tactic for just that long.<sup cn></sup>

And then after the rise of AIDS, gay men wanted to look as ripped as possible so as to not appear sick, since people with AIDS, especially advanced AIDS, tended to have muscle wasting.

And then, as a community, gay men just kept up with the same regimen. We go to the gym and eat crazy diets, despite not having to show that we're not dying. We go to the gym, despite being able to hook up just about anywhere. *Because* we still want those perfect Nazi soldier bodies, whether we call them that or not. 

But those soldiers were paid and required to look like that,<sup cn></sup> but a switch has flipped within the community. It's no longer that we find those bodies an attractive option and would like them for ourselves. 

Now, if you don't have that body, you're worthless, you're shunned, you're subhuman. Sound familiar?

Severe depression among gay men has actually increased<sup cn></sup> since it's become more acceptable to be out because now that the world sees what some gay men look like, the impression becomes that *all* gay men must look like that, and if you don't well, you better get to work.<sup cn></sup> 

This has led to the abuse of steroids and illegal drugs to try and build muscle and satiate appetites, anorexia and bulimia... and even giving up... with suicide. 

We hold up certain body types as the goal and even the expectation for what beauty inside the gay community is, but not everyone can achieve those bodies no matter how much they diet or work out. And not just because biology sometimes works against you, like with thyroid issues and rare food sensitivities.

Nothing neccesarily wrong with this [passage], though it could use some citations, but mental health concerns, including depression, drug abuse, eating disorders, and suicide, are also problems in the rest of the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, according to [a 2022 briefing from The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Embargoed_Feb-2022-Research-Brief.pdf), among US LGBTQ+ people age 13-24, cisgender boys/men actually have the lowest rates of eating disorders, while cisgender girls/women and transfeminine youth have higher rates, and transmasculine youth have the highest rates. Obviously, this doesn't mean make cis queer men's body image issues any less valid, but at least a mention of other parts of the community would've been... nice?

This past summer I found out that I lacked the enzymes required to properly digest carbohydrates, which meant my body was holding on to every last carb I ate. The long delayed explanation for why I couldn't lose weight, no matter how healthy I ate. The condition is called [hyperinsulinemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinsulinemia). And I also have a generalized carbohydrate intolerance, it turns out. It's incredibly rare and related to diabetes. Surprise, I have that family history and I've been warned by doctors since my teens to be on the lookout. It's *not* diabetes though, it's just diabetes-adjacent.

It was...... one of the strangest feelings in the world, after I'd been dismissed by nearly every medical professional as just cheating on diet plans, to after three decades on this planet be informed that there *is* an actual reason for it... 

I have to try to not think about what my life would have been like if any doctor or dietitian had decided to run the weird tests... instead of just telling me to eat less and exercise. Maybe the reason it's so *rare* is because doctors are... well, they *can* be very quick to say that you being fat is the root of all your health problems, when in reality maybe being fat is just a *symptom* of the real problem.

I was lucky enough to have a doctor who looked at my chart, listened to me when I told her what my diet for the last ten years had been like, that even when I was doing the starving student thing I still lost almost nothing. She looked at my medical records and said, "I want to bring you in for one more test." The medical community itself is stuffed with very fat-shame-y sentiments. Only they don't call you fat, they call you "unhealthy".

Now I don't want to generalize all doctors like this, but from someone who has gotten the same shade from a lot of them, the medical community is very rooted in promoting beauty standards. Given how slim their BMI charts are, I'm pretty sure the overwhelming majority of people are either overweight or obese.

I'm not sure which SS twink they used as a gold standard, but there is some *seriously* unrealistic expectations about what a body should be. How many teenagers develop eating disorders just because they stepped on a scale in their doctor's office?

And they lean *right in* to meal plans and specialists and dietitians, supplements and shakes. Some of the more enterprising doctors will even have spas or wellness centers and will push their diet subscriptions onto their patients, which... that isn't illegal, but it sounds like it should be.

Teenagers developing eating disorders because of the doctor or the scale at the doctor's office is a well-known problem that part of the medical community (particularly newer doctors) are well aware of and things are being tried. Some doctors are trying things like not showing patients their weight unless specifically asked. (Source: family members in the medical field.) <u>[TODO, link actual sources.]</u>

We are told to trust doctors and many of us do. That's a lot of power given to someone who's trying to sell you what may very well amount to snake oil. And doctors have a *very* easy time diagnosing someone as fat, especially given how many tests and hoops they make you jump through to get *anything else* diagnosed. 

It's easy for someone to make money off of fat people when the entire culture they live in drives them into crippling anxiety and puts them under extreme pressure to just *not be fat anymore.* Especially when the culture has a more limited ideal of body standards. Not even perfection. On some of my infrequent forrays into heterosexual social media, it is plastered with cringe-worthy declarations about what the opposite sex *should be*. 

And yes it comes from men and women. Because neither group really knows how the other group's body works.

(Okay, somebody's got to say this): gay men are not alone. There are a horde of ladies out there who do think that it is *perfectly reasonable* to expect men to have that superhero body all the time. 

In fact, Tenoch Huerta, the MCU's Namor, came under a degree of criticism for not having *the* body. You know, the one that Captain America has. Ironically, not from the gays, who thirsted after him, his nose ring, and his man pearls from the get-go; these were women and straight men who were upset... about his back. (Oh well, more for us.)

Please stop describing women as "hordes." I would have probably overlooked this if it weren't for that one clip from the Dahmer video living in my head rent-free. 

[Anyway, the main person body shaming Tenoch Huerta as Namor was Mike Deodato Jr., a comic book artist.](https://movieweb.com/former-marvel-comic-artist-not-impressed-with-namor-black-panther-2/) As far as I can tell, he was pretty universally torn apart for his opinion, causing him to delete the post.

At least for the gays, we have groups that tolerate a range of ways to be fit or attractive, and the more thick fellows we depict as sexually appealing in media, the more we will seek *that* desirability in real life. 

Conversely, Warner Brothers Executives in 2021 (at least the ones who were there at the time) were having a collective meltdown leading up to the release of *The Batman*. It turned out Robert Pattinson was struggling to put on the bulk that Christian Bale had. Because they wanted to have that shirtless Batman shot. And Pattinson did look good for his obligatory shirtless sequence, but it was far from what stood out most in the movie. In my opinion, I don't think the world's greatest detective and ninja needs to look like Brock Lesnar.

But back to Namor: The matter of the fact is that Namor's body isn't really something that would feel out of place on a rugby field. It was a subverted expectation for the swimmer's body he has in the comics, which I think is perfectly okay. But that said, it wouldn't make sense at all for any aquatic superhero to have *dehydrated abs*.

The swimmer's body is, for some reason, the body type that the gays (and a lot of straight guys) default to. Author and queen Eric Shaw Quinn has said,

> <mark fc=false stat:id="made-quote">"There's not enough swimming pools in Los Angeles for all the men who say they have a 'swimmer's body.'"</mark><sup cn></sup> 

Personal trainers and training apps get this kind of request all the time, as if people think they can just morph their body like that. Sorry, but that in itself would be a superpower. 

People's bodies are the way they are and they can't control the distribution of muscle mass or their bone structure. There is a *version* of fit that they can accomplish, but it might not be a swimmer's body.

Another thing that happens is skinny guys wish they could bulk up to have a rugby build, which also probably cannot happen. There's a kind of athletic determinism when it comes to fitness. We look at swimmers and say, "all that swimming has given him a swimmer's body," but the truth is actually the inverse. The person had the right kind of body to be able to succeed in competitive swimming.<sup cn></sup> It's more accurate to say that 'he is a swimmer because he has a swimmer's body'. 

This isn't always the case, but in most cases people tend to gravitate to the sport that they do because their body type thrives in that environment. Whereas a thicker or chunkier guy would struggle in the water because he's not built to accommodate fluid dynamics.

But again, some bodies aren't designed for ripped six-pack abs. Some people will always be a bit bigger... like me. 

Even after figuring out after 25 years that my body really was working against me, I know that once I do lose the weight, I'll *never* look like those Instagram models and I'll probably never live up to the expectations of some of those headless torsos on Grindr. 

But I'll be able to go into a store and buy a button-up shirt that fits. I'll be able to go for a run without feeling like I'm about to have a heart attack. I won't look like what the expectation is for multiple reasons: my head is too round, my chest is too broad, my legs are too thick. As much as it would break my teenage self's heart, I'll never be a twink.

And that's okay. You shouldn't have to look a specific way to meet the bare minimum body standards for this community. So I think a healthy way to move forward is to aim to be exactly that: healthy. As a community, that should be our goal. Not ripped, but healthy. Make *that* the standard for the community, and that'll even take some of the pressure *off* of the gym bunnies and hopefully end the epidemic of eating disorders that queer men have been suffering from for decades.

Fight back against the rising tide of body fascism. Because fascists suck. Why would you want to look like the type of person... that Hitler thought was perfect?
