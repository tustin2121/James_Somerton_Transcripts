Hey, guys. I'm just in the process of editing the video that you're about to watch, and I thought I would drop a severe content warning right here. It's. It's a lot. Obviously, there's discussion of the murder of queer people. That's what the video's about. But there's also instances of audio that was taken from the killers, one of which they consistently refer to a trans woman as he made sure to keep any kind of dead naming or anything like that out of there.

But I just wanted you to know that that's there. There's some violent shots. There's some a couple of kind of brutal images as well, because I really wanted to get the point across. So, you know, if you feel like you need to take a break watching it or anything like that, by all means. Also, for a lot of the victims, there's not a lot of pictures of them.

In early February 2008, in Oxnard, California, a 15 year old named Larry asked a fellow eighth grader named Brandon to be their valentine. Somehow, our society had given Brandon the impression that this innocent request was tantamount to a criminal offense. And so on February 12th, Brandon murdered Larry, shooting them twice in the back of the head. The first trial ended in a mistrial with several members of the jury agreeing with the defense's use of queer panic, stating that by Larry coming on to Brandon, they were essentially bullying him, leaving him with no choice but to kill the 15 year old.

The Queer Panic, or better known as gay or trans Panic. Defense has been a legal defense tactic for three quarters of a century in the United States and abroad. The murder of Larry in 2008 is just a recent and particularly venomous example and may actually fall under both gay and trans panic. Though Larry presented as a boy, many people who knew them stated after their death that they wanted to change their name to Latisha and possibly transition.

We won't know if Larry would have ever done that, though, because they only spent 15 years on this earth before rabid hatred took them from us all. I wish Larry was the only example of this. I wish Queer Panic was an obscure mention in a dusty legal book somewhere. But there's a sad, dark history to this rationalization of hate masquerading as a legal defense.

While there is more acceptance of the LGBTQ community today than there was even in 2008. It's worth noting that only nine months after Larry's murder, California voted to ban gay marriage. Queer people still experience significant amounts of prejudice and discrimination. Approximately 70% of gay men and women have been the victims of verbal abuse, with 30% being the victims of physical harm.

While 80% of transgender people in America have reported being physically attacked in some way. Violence against the community is a problem, even in cities with sizable queer populations. In a survey of young adults in San Francisco, one in five men admitted to physically assaulting or at least threatening people they assumed to be gay or trans.

A common defense strategy to use is the concept of queer panic. There is no officially recognized queer panic defense in the legal books, but many use the term to refer to defense strategies that rely on the notion that a criminal defendant should be excused or even justified if their violent actions were in response to the perceived sexual advances of a queer person.

</james>
<from></from>

{% assign timecode = "00:07:09" %}

Such strategies include using queer panic to bolster claims of temporary insanity, diminished capacity, provocation and self-defense. So let's have a look at the history of this often derided but too often successful legal defense, why it exists, why it succeeds, and what can be done about it.

The use of queer panic in murder cases has its roots in theories of latent homosexuality as a mental disorder. The term homosexual panic was coined by Dr. Edward Kemp, a clinical psychiatrist, in 1920 after treating many patients who exhibited similar characteristics. Kemp came to the conclusion that certain troubled individuals who thought of themselves as heterosexual males were actually latent homosexuals.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:09:06" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

These individuals suffered from an internal conflict between their feelings of attraction to people of the same sex and societal views of such feelings as perverse. They also experienced a heightened sense of anxiety in same sex environments, caused by this tension. According to Kemp, the male patient afflicted with homosexual panic would be attracted to same sex associations and horrified by the amorous female.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:09:33" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

After heterosexual failure, the patient would become anxious, depressed and sometimes suicidal. Interestingly, separation from an individual of the same sex to whom the patient was attracted rather than a homosexual offense would precipitate a panicked state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the official list of psychiatric disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association, listed homosexual panic disorder in its 1952 edition.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:10:00" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But the term has not appeared in the manual since then. While Kemp's original theory has been stretched almost beyond the breaking point in its use as a defense in the criminal courtroom today, modern support does exist for the idea that men who self-identify as straight and who express hostility toward queer people may actually be latent homosexuals themselves. In 1996, there was a study conducted to find out whether straight men who exhibited strong anti-gay sentiments would be aroused by gay porn.

</james>
<from></from>

{% assign timecode = "00:10:30" %}

It included 64 participants who, after much testing, were broken up into two groups one for obvious homophobes and one for straight men who were more or less indifferent. A sensor was placed on the penises of each man before they were sat down to watch gay porn. The censor recorded full erections only in the homophobic group. Kemp's study has since been used to back up the use of the queer panic defense that latent homosexuality is in and of itself a mental disorder.

Therefore, excusing the defendant as being not in control of their own faculties by using the gay panic defense, they are essentially admitting to be latently queer themselves. A nuance many of the defendants, I'm sure, are unaware of. Gay panic in and of itself is a useless defense. It must be attached to something more meaty, something you can win over a jury with excuse or justification.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:11:26" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

An excuse defense is one in which the defendant's conduct is viewed as wrongful, but that he himself is not seen as morally at fault. A justification defense, on the other hand, focuses on the defendant's conduct more than his individual characteristics. A justification defense argues that the attacker's conduct was appropriate under the circumstances. Truthfully, it's difficult to argue that queer panic should be called either a justification or an excuse.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:11:52" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Justification suggests the defendant did the right thing in killing the victim, that he did what society would have wanted him to do. And an excuse defense suggests that the killer is not as morally blameworthy as he would have been had he killed a straight man or a cisgender woman. Both, in my humble opinion, our bullshit. Even most defense attorneys know that, so they very rarely try to argue for either justification or excuse.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:12:18" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Instead, they lean toward insanity. Heterosexual men charged with killing gay men have argued that the victim's homosexual advances triggered in them a violent, psychotic reaction, causing them to lose control over their mental abilities. But always, always in a temporary manner, they were perfectly sane again after they were done killing them. There are several problems with defense attempts to claim insanity linked to gay panic.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:12:46" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

First to be found Ngai not guilty by insanity. A defendant must not have understood the nature of his act or appreciated that what he was doing was wrong. In other words, either he did not know that he was stabbing, choking or kicking the victim, or he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The male defendant claiming that a homosexual advance made him lose his self-control often cannot claim convincingly that he did not know that he was attacking the victim or that he did not understand that what he was doing was illegal or at least immoral.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

{% assign timecode = "00:13:20" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Second, to be found, Ngai, the defendant, must have been suffering from a mental disease or defect at the time of his act. The defendant claiming that a gay or trans advance made him crazy often cannot prove he was suffering from a mental illness or defect at the time of his act. Because the American Psychiatric Association does not recognize homosexual panic disorder as an actual disorder, they do have one other option, though diminished capacity.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Another hook for defendants charged with murdering a gay man or trans woman is the diminished capacity defense. Diminished capacity. A partial defense to murder generally requires proof that the defendant was acting under the influence of a psychological illness that made it impossible for him to premeditate the murder. Unlike excuse, justification or insanity. This argument will not have you set free, but it will at the very least remove the possible charge of first degree murder, which could result in life in prison or the death penalty.

Now that we've taken a law class, it's time to take a history class. David Kammerer Though you likely know the names Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs as literary giants, the first time their names appeared in print was when they were arrested as material witnesses to the murder of David Kammerer by Lucien Carr. David Kammerer and Carr had met in Saint Louis at a summer camp for boys when Camara was an instructor, and Carr, a student from a middle class family.

{% assign timecode = "00:14:52" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

Kammerer earned a Ph.D. in English and had taught literature and physical education at Washington University. What started as an infatuation then turned into a decade long attraction. He followed the young Carr across the country, from Andover to the University of Chicago to Maine, before moving to New York City. When Carr entered Columbia University. The Burroughs biographer, Ted Morgan, related that while many believed these moves reflected Carr's attempts to get away from Kammerer, others were dubious.

{% assign timecode = "00:15:22" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

For when you saw them together, they seemed to be the best of friends drinking and horsing around. The pair were friends with both Kerouac and Burroughs, who both reportedly had a crush on the young Carr. He was like a magnet for men struggling with their sexualities, not just Kammerer, Kerouac and Burroughs, but Allen Ginsberg as well. It was later postulated that this was because of Carr's feminine look.

</james>

{% assign timecode = "00:15:47" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

Kerouac in particular was torn. He was engaged to a wealthy heiress, Edie Parker, but head over heels For Carr, Kammerer had become intensely jealous when both Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg competed for Carr's affection. Ultimately, Kerouac and Carr formed a close relationship with her. Carr, Ever engaged with any of these men sexually is still up for debate. He certainly drew their attention and seemed to have no problem flirting with them even in public.

So it shouldn't have come as a shock when David Kammerer finally made a move on him. Carr responded by digging his Boy Scout knife into Camera's heart multiple times. Once the man was dead on the ground, car tied his hands and feet, wrapped cameras, belt around his arms, weighted his body with rocks, and then dumped it in the nearby Hudson River.

Carr fled to William Burroughs for help. Burroughs gave Carr some money and advised him to turn himself in. Baker went to see Kerouac instead. Kerouac helped Carr get rid of the knife and bury cameras, glasses. Two days later, Carr confessed to police. At first they didn't believe the young man's story. But the same day the Coast Guard found camera, his body floating off 108th Street.

Once in custody, Carr told police that over the years of their acquaintance, Kammerer had several times made improper advances to him, but that he had always rebuffed the older man. The phrase improper advances was not new to crime stories in the 1940s. Since the late 19th century, such terms were common in the press to describe verbal and physical assaults on women.

They connoted criminal actions that simmered with sexual abuses, too shocking to make explicit. While the terms improper advance or indecent advance appeared in queer crime stories in the thirties, it was the post-World War two years when such terms came to embody the perceived threats of gay men. Initially, Assistant District Attorney Jacob Grimmett had doubts about Carr's confession, telling the New York Times he was uncertain whether he was dealing with a slayer or a lunatic.

Determining whether the crime was the work of a vulnerable teenager or a crazed, psychopathic queer lover would become the compelling question for detectives and journalists alike. Solving this mystery depended on solving the riddle of Carr's sexuality. Initial press accounts described Carr with a myriad of unmanly attributes, including a pale, slender youth, refined and a frail, blond youth whose frail, build and earnest expression might easily arouse sympathy.

The New York tabloids presented the teen as a helpless victim of a psychotic homosexual attack. The Daily Mirror called the crime a twisted sex murder. The New York Daily News described Carr stabbing as an honor slaying. The Daily News contrasted the mild expression on Carr's young face against the 33 year old former English teacher, drawing this contrast between youthful innocence and sexual deviance.

It was often difficult to discern who was the real victim of the crime. By September, when Carr entered a guilty plea of second degree manslaughter, the assistant district attorney believed the car had not intended to kill Kammerer, a homosexual. But the camera for more than five years had persisted in making advances to Carr, which always were repulsed. Cameras persistence had made young Carr emotionally unstable.

In her testimony, Mrs. Carr described Kammerer as a veritable Iago who had corrupted her son purely for the love of evil. Carr served only two years in a reformatory. Whether Kammerer was a sexual predator, murdered in self-defense or Carr was mentally unstable, have both been argued ever since. Not long before the murder.

The facts in this case are elastic, with too many contradicting stories over the last seven decades. But wherever the truth may lie, one thing is for sure, though the gay panic defense was not technically used in this case. It seeds were planted in the honor killing defense. The ability to more or less get away with murder. If you felt threatened by someone's sexuality, making the victim into the monster.

On the evening of August 2nd, 1954, Simpson landed at Miami International Airport after a final shift working aboard a flight from Detroit.

Simpson never made it to his date. It is believed that on the way there he was propositioned by a young man named Charles Lawrence on the side of the road. Unknown to Simpson, Lawrence was notorious for rolling gay men, as local media called it, then luring them to a secluded spot where his accomplice, Lewis Killen, would jump out and help rob the victim.

Usually, Killen would wait until Lawrence began engaging in sexual activity with the victim before attempting the robbery killing. And Lawrence would not kill their victim. But in Simpson's case, for reasons still not clear, something spooked Lawrence when Simpson didn't cooperate like the other victims had. Lawrence shot him in his left side and Simpson stumbling out of the car, Finally tossed over his keys and wallet before collapsing a few yards away.

According to the North Miami police report, Lawrence and Killen made off with $25 and claimed they thought Simpson would live. They said they were surprised when they found out the next day that he had died. Miami Daily News reporter Milt Susan was on the story from the moment it broke. He wrote his first front page article aptly titled Eagle Eastern Airlines Man is Slain on Lover's Lane, along with the headline, there was a picture of the head of Simpson's corpse.

Susan suspected Simpson was gay because of the location in which the murder took place. Susan referenced the potential killer as a man and suggested that it was possibly a sex crime. The story immediately gained traction. But rather than trying to report on the heinous crime itself, Susan instead focused on Simpson's sexuality. At the time, homosexuality was rarely mentioned in mainstream media, so it made Susan's writing all the more salacious.

Following the police investigation, Susan learned that the police were more interested in busting a colony of 500 gay men in the area than apprehending the murderers. Susan followed suit. The follow up front page story focused on Simpson's sexuality rather than the crime. In a story on August 9th, 1954, with the headline Pervert Colony uncovered in Simpson Slaying Probe, the article detailed that gay men congregated in a northeastern part of downtown Miami around where the Omni center is today.

The article went on to further accuse Simpson of mixing with the wrong crowd and getting involved in gay drama, which it suggested might have been the motive behind the murder.

There was no doubt about who committed the crime, though Lawrence and Killen both admitted to the murder.

Testifying in November of 1954 that while they did like to roll gay men, Simpson took it too far. They claimed Simpson made them feel unsafe and made unwanted sexual advances toward Lawrence.

Simpson's murder was the catalyst of what quickly seemed like endless homophobia in South Florida. Various Christian activist groups stepped up and called for Dade County politicians to rid the area of homosexuality by raiding known gay bars, clubs and hangout spots.

In the 1950s, during Joseph McCarthy's Red Scare, more gay men were fired from government jobs and suspected communists. The so-called lavender scare among lawmakers, lawyers and judges easily transformed into gay panic.

There was hope after Matthew's murder that the country would wake up, that the LGBT community in America would no longer have to fear for their lives. But before Matthew's murderers even entered a courtroom, people's hopes would be sadly dashed. Billy Jack Gaither, Sylacauga, Alabama, had less than 13,000 residents with seven churches when Billy Jack lived there. Only around 100 gay people lived there, but most weren't open.

When single he would go to gay or at least gay inclusive bars in more populated areas of the state.

Gaither was a regular there, another regular, Steve Mullins, also started hanging out at the tavern. His presence, though, wasn't quite so benign. He sometimes showed up wearing racist t shirts and harassing African-American customers. He was known locally as a wannabe skinhead. People mentioned later that they saw Mullins and Gaither together at the bar a lot. Assuming that Gaither was talking him out of his borderline white supremacist ways, sometimes they would leave together, which made some people assume that they had a sexual relationship when in reality, Billy Jack was well known for driving his drunk friends home at the end of the night.

Mullins had recently taken to hanging out with a man named Charles Butler. They'd known each other for years because Mullins had lived with Butler's cousin. The two were hanging out at the tavern one night when Billy Jack arrived a few hours later. No one was surprised when Billy Jack offered the pair drive home.

From all accounts, the proposition never actually happened. Billy Jack never had encounters with men from Sylacauga for fear that word would get back to his parents.

Though accounts for Mullins and Butler differ. We know that once they had arrived at the creek, the two began beating Billy, striking him over the head until he fell to the ground.

Their deaths are left painfully vague to the point where it's easier to find information on their killers than on the women themselves.

In 2020 and 20, 21 years in which most people have barely left their houses.

More trans and gender nonconforming people have been murdered in America than in any year prior. These people were killed by people they knew, people they loved and people they'd never met before. Some have been arrested and charged. Others have yet to be identified. Some of these cases involve clear transphobe women, while in others the victims where gender identity may have put them at risk due to unemployment, poverty and homelessness.

Dozens of trans people are murdered every year in the United States, and these are conservative members. The police have a tendency to misgender victims who are not ID'd or to identify them by their dead names. When They can be ID'd. So the real number of trans people lost to us each year is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.

In 2013, the American Bar Association unanimously passed a resolution imploring states to ban the use of the queer panic defense. But as of December 2021, only 11 states have done so. Though I've only discussed the queer panic defense within America. It is by no means a uniquely American problem. Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and the UK also have their own versions of the defense with varying rates of success and legality.

Many judges today reject the defense immediately, and many juries will hold it against the defense for trying to use it. There's a stigma against the defense now, even if it is still perfectly legal in 39 states. But just because jurors and judges may dismiss the use of queer panic, it's not a sure thing. The only way to ensure that justice is achieved in the murder of queer people is to enact a legislative ban on the gay and trans panic defenses, something 11 states have done.

But what of the other 39? The Biden administration should put forward a bill flat out banning the use of the defense. Do away with it once and for all to show the homophobic and transphobic, hateful bigots that know it is not okay to kill people for being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender or gender non-conforming. Our lives mean just as much as everyone else's.

You will not get away with killing us. You will not get a reduced sentence for killing us. Every year across America, people are killed for being who they are. They're killed because of the fragile masculinity of little men. Their lives ended in brutal, ugly nightmares because some their lives are worth nothing. That they won't be missed. That once they're dead and gone, their names will fade into obscurity.

Because for decades, centuries, that's what's happened. Our names were lost, our lives forgotten. But we will not forget. We cannot forget the names. Lives of the people lost to homophobia and transphobia. The sons and daughters whose parents will never see grow up. The people who have fallen to these crimes, the so-called panic. They were already taken away from US ones.

We have to make sure it doesn't happen again. So mourn their deaths and celebrate their lives, and most importantly, remember their names. Because now is the time to mourn those we've lost and fight like hell for those we've still got.
