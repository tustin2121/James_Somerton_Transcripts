Hey guys. I'm just in the process of editing the video that you're about to watch, and I thought I would drop a *severe* content warning right here. It's... it's a lot. Obviously, there's discussion of the murder of queer people. That's what the video's about. But there's also instances of audio that was taken from the killers, one of which they consistently refer to a trans woman as "he." I've made sure to keep any kind of deadnaming or anything like that out of there.

But I just wanted you to know that that's there. There's some violent shots. There's some, a couple of kind of brutal images as well, because I really wanted to get the point across. So, you know, if you feel like you need to take a break watching it or anything like that, by all means. Oh, also, for a lot of the victims, there's not a lot of pictures of them.

In early February 2008, in Oxnard, California, a 15 year old named Larry asked a fellow eighth grader named Brandon to be their valentine. Somehow, our society had given Brandon the impression that this innocent request was tantamount to a criminal offense. And so on February 12th, Brandon murdered Larry, shooting them twice in the back of the head. The first trial ended in a mistrial with several members of the jury agreeing with the defense's use of queer panic, stating that by Larry coming on to Brandon, they were essentially bullying him, leaving him with no choice but to kill the 15 year old.

On February 12th, an openly gay 15-year-old boy named Larry who was an eighth-grader in Oxnard, California was murdered by a fellow eighth-grader named Brandon. Larry was killed because he . . . was gay. Days before he was murdered, Larry asked his killer to be his Valentine . . . . And somewhere along the line the killer Brandon got the message that it’s so threatening and so awful and so horrific that Larry would want to be his Valentine that killing Larry seemed to be the right
thing to do. And when the message out there is [that it is] so horrible . . . to be gay you can be killed for it, we need to change the message.

The queer panic, or better known as gay or trans panic, defense has been a legal defense tactic for three quarters of a century in the United States and abroad. The murder of Larry in 2008 is just a recent and particularly venomous example and may actually fall under both gay and trans panic. Though Larry presented as a boy, many people who knew them stated after their death that they wanted to change their name to Latisha and possibly transition.

We won't know if Larry would have ever done that, though, because they only spent 15 years on this earth before rabid hatred took them from us all. I wish Larry was the only example of this. I wish queer panic was an obscure mention in a dusty legal book somewhere. But there's a sad, dark histoy to this rationalization of hate masquerading as a legal defense.

<mark>The use of queer panic in murder cases has its roots in theories of latent homosexuality as a mental disorder. The term homosexual panic was coined by Dr. Edward Kempf, a clinical psychiatrist, in 1920. After treating many patients who exhibited similar characteristics, Kempf came to the conclusion that certain troubled individuals who thought of themselves as heterosexuals were actually latent homosexuals. These individuals suffered from an internal conflict between their feelings of attraction to people of the same sex and societal views of such feelings as perverse. They also experienced a heightened sense of anxiety in same sex environments, caused by this tension.</mark>

He then placed a sensor on the penises of all the participants, and measured penile response to erotic videotapes involving heterosexuals, lesbians, and gay men engaging in sexual activity. Only the men in Adams’s homophobic category showed an increase in penile erection in response to male homosexual erotic stimuli.<sup>49</sup>

Kempf's study has since been used to back up the use of the queer panic defense that latent homosexuality is in and of itself a mental disorder, therefore excusing the defendant as being not in control of their own faculties. By using the gay panic defense, they are essentially admitting to be latently queer themselves. A nuance many of the defendants, I'm sure, are unaware of.

Even if some self-identified straight men who express strongly negative feelings about homosexuality are actually latent homosexuals repressing their own homoerotic desires, the idea that gay panic should excuse the killing of a gay man is problematic for several reasons. First, treating gay panic as a mental disorder suggests that homophobia<sup>50</sup> linked to latent homosexuality is a mental illness.<sup>51</sup> Studies, however, indicate that negative attitudes about homosexuality tend to come from two sources: sexual conservatism and prejudice.<sup>52</sup> Although some mental health practitioners might feel otherwise,<sup>53</sup> sexually conservative individuals and prejudiced individuals are not necessarily mentally ill.

</from>
<comment> 

James seems to be taking the "latent homosexuality is a mental illness" fragment and running with it. First of all, that wasn't Kempf's study, it was Henry Adams' study, Kempf just had theories based on his practice. Second of all, the study, which was from 1996, has not been used to argue that "latent homosexuality is a mental illness," because homosexual panic and homosexuality have not been considered mental disorders, at least in the DSM, since the early 70s. [Homosexual panic, as a disorder, and the homosexual panic defense, are distinct, because a person using the homosexual panic defense is typically arguing *temporary* insanity (or provocation or self defense), not that they have a mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense#Use_of_the_gay_panic_defense). I guess you *could* argue that people who use the gay panic defense are admitting to being latently queer, based on the term's origin, but that's really a stretch, and it's pretty homophobic to imply that everyone who uses the gay panic defense is gay themselves. Or maybe he's just saying it's ironic that a heterosexual homophobe is accidentally admitting to being gay, I don't know.

Gay panic in and of itself is a useless defense. It must be attached to something more meaty, something you can win over a jury with. 

<mark>Excuse or justification. [Title card with A|Excuse or justification appears.]</mark> <mark>An excuse defense is one in which the defendant's conduct is viewed as wrongful, but that he himself is not seen as morally at fault. A justification defense, on the other hand, focuses on the defendant's conduct more than his individual characteristics. A justification defense argues that the attacker's conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.</mark>

<mark>*A. Excuse or Justification?*</mark>

A preliminary question is whether gay panic, if allowed as a defense argument, should be recognized as an excuse or a justification. An excuse defense is one in which the actor’s conduct is viewed as wrongful, but the actor himself is not seen as morally blameworthy.<sup>75</sup> A justification defense, in contrast, focuses on the actor’s conduct more than the individual characteristics of the actor.<sup>76</sup> A justification defense says the actor’s conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.<sup>77</sup> Examples of excuse defenses include insanity, duress, and intoxication. Necessity, self-defense, and defense of others are usually considered justification defenses.

<footer>

Truthfully, <mark>it's difficult to argue that queer panic should be called either a justification or an excuse.

No, attorneys have to argue excuse or justification, or they're not going to get anywhere with a gay panic defense. The text literally says that out of the gay panic defense arguments, "provocation is a partial excuse defense, self-defense is a justification defense, and insanity and diminished capacity are excuse defenses."

<mark>There are several problems with defense attempts to claim insanity linked to gay panic.

<mark>Another doctrinal hook for defendants charged with murdering a gay man is the diminished capacity defense. Diminished capacity, a partial defense to murder, generally requires proof that the defendant was acting under the influence of a mental disease or defect which affected his capacity to premeditate and deliberate or form the requisite intent to kill.</mark> There are two variants of the diminished capacity defense. Under the mens rea variant, “evidence that [the defendant] suffered from a mental disease or defect at the time of his conduct is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that he lacked a mental state that is an element of the charged offense.”<sup>103</sup> Under the partial responsibility variant, the charge is reduced from murder to manslaughter because the defendant is seen as “less blameworthy and therefore less deserving of punishment, than a killer who acts with a normal state of mind.”<sup>104</sup>

The pair were friends with both Kerouac and Burroughs, who both reportedly had a crush on the young Carr.

Kerouac in particular was torn.

James changes first-degreee to second-degree, presumably because the Medium article says "he pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter." I looked but I couldn't find which one he actually pleaded. I suspect it was first-degree manslaughter because it makes more sense from what I read about New York laws; second-degree manslaughter, also called reckless homicide, is when you unintentionally cause someone else's death through reckless behavior, while first-degree manslaughter is when you intentionally kill someone while in a state of "extreme emotional disturbance."

Carr served only two years in a reformatory. Whether Kammerer was a sexual predator, murdered in self-defense or Carr was mentally unstable, have both been argued ever since.

Parisi was convicted of manslaughter, but upon appeal was set free. The appeals court stated that "by not allowing more witnesses to testify that Robert Jackson was homosexual, but allowing Jackson's wife to speak. The original judge allowed too much doubt to seep in. If the jury were completely convinced of his perversity, a full acquittal would have been likely." And so John, Steven Parisi was let back into the world, a world Robert Jackson no longer lived in.

Todd:

so it is true that after 14 years in prison perzi did win his appeal in 1982 partially because of the suppressed Witnesses however this quote right here the one where the judge calls the dead gay man a pervert and said his perversions would have led to an acqu I am almost certain that this quote is completely fabricated it does not appear in the source he's pulling from and it does not appear in any of the court rulings of which there were several uh it's possible that I just don't know my way around legal documents well enough to find the source of this quote 

but also just on basic logic I don't buy it the gay Panic defense is used to get leniency not AC quiddle Summerton says that himself earlier in the video and it's definitely not likely that pesi would have been acquitted perzi said beforehand that he was going to go quote roll a queer because he needed the money and when he was arrested he was in possession of the victim's wallet wedding ring and car plus the prosecutor debunked gay Panic as made up anyway so even with the testimony I don't buy that he would have been acquitted a judge did not say that 

finally I did consult with some lawyers about these court documents thank you Devon legal eagle and Jewish lawyer lib on Twitter and based on what they told me I think the entire conclusion of this segment is wrong that's not sum's fault the Source he's using misinterpreted the case but what actually happened was perzi won the right to a retrial in 1982 not his freedom just a retrial however the state appealed that ruling and a year later the court changed its mind based on like minor procedural stuff like perzi missed a filing deadline somewhere along the line so the first appeal was overturned and the original guilty verdict stood perizzy did not get his retrial and again that's not sum's fault his Source was wrong but the embellishments he added those do belong to him and they make the initial error much worse the prosecutor had argued that the victim probably wasn't even gay and one appeals judge thought if you're going to call this guy a liar he has the right to prove you wrong if you think they were maybe some biased undertones to that decision uh you know what go ahead and make that case but the decision was about the right to a fair trial not whether it's okay to murder perverts he's once again fabricating evidence to support someone else's conclusion which in this case wasn't even valid 

<comment>

Also, Reggie (and then James) claims that Parisie was convicted for manslaughter, but none of the records of the case I could find mentioned manslaughter, only murder. It wouldn't make sense anyway; manslaughter wouldn't get a 40 to 70 year sentence, the sentence length that Reggie claims.

The Jenny Jones Show was a daytime tabloid talk show that ran for 12 years between 1991 and 2003. Low ratings and early seasons led the show to pivot to voyeuristic, exploitive content inspired by successes from talk show hosts such as Jerry Springer and Maury Povich. For example, Jenny Jones would bring in a woman who slept with a married man and his wife, encouraging them to confront one another in front of her live studio audience. She'd surprise a couple with a paternity test result. On air, have spouses reveal affairs and break up with their partners.

It was later stated by Donna that Amador and Schmitz went out drinking together that night after the taping and an alleged sexual encounter actually occurred. Though this has never actually been confirmed, after the trio flew home, Jonathan called his father to tell him what happened. Jonathan found it quite funny, but his father reportedly was not so easy going. In a later trial, his father admitted to telling his son that if he didn't do something about this, that people would think he was gay. Specifically, he had to kill Scott. Otherwise people would think he had been okay with the gay advances. Though he admitted under oath to coercing his son into committing murder. Jonathan's father was never tried.

Schmitz was charged with first-degree murder and committing a felony with a firearm. To convict him of first-degree murder, prosecutors must prove that the murder was premeditated. If convicted of this charge, Schmitz faces life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The jury is alowed to consider lesser charges, such as second-degree murder or manslaughter.

The prosecution argued that though Schmitz may have been embarrassed by the Jenny Jones taping. It did not justify his killing of Amador. Schmitz drove to one store to purchase a shotgun, drove to another for ammunition, and then drove to Amador his home before firing the fatal shots that demonstrated premeditation. Prosecutors contended that when Schmitz went to Amador, his mobile home, Schmitz became violent. They said that the police report indicating an upturned chair at the crime scene shows that Amador was trying to defend himself. The state had an oral confession and a videotaped confession from Schmitz. In a pretrial hearing, however, the judge ruled that both confessions were inadmissible.

The Prosecution's Case

Though Schmitz may have been embarrassed by the Jenny Jones taping, it did not justify his killing Amedure, the state argued. Schmitz drove to one store to purchase a shotgun, drove to another for ammunition, and drove to Amedure's home before firing the fatal shots. That demonstrates premeditation, prosecutors said. 

Prosecutors contended that when Schmitz went to Amedure's mobile home, Schmitz became violent. They say that a police report indicating an upturned chair at the crime scene shows that Amedure was trying to defend himself. 

The State had an oral confession and a videotaped confession. In a pretrial hearing, however, the judge ruled that both confessions were inadmissible because the oral confession was made without Schmitz being read his Miranda rights and the videotaped confession was made while his right to counsel was being violated.

SCHMITZ His attorneys argued the defense of diminished capacity. They claimed Schmitz lacked the mental state required to have committed premeditated murder when he shot Amador. According to the defense's theory, Schmitz simply snapped. After finding the note on his doorstep. Lawyers argued that the very idea of being perceived as gay broke SCHMITZ mentally, that it would do so to any man. But Schmitz, who apparently suffered from manic depression, was particularly vulnerable that he felt the world was falling down on him and that the only way he could stop his mental spiral was to kill Scott. This was years before his father admitted to demanding that he kill his friend.

Schmitz's attorneys argued the defense of diminished capacity. They claimed Schmitz lacked the mental state required to have committed premeditated murder when he shot Amedure.

According to the defense's theory, Schmitz simply snapped after finding the note on his doorstep. Lawyers attributed Schmitz' reaction to Grave's disease -- a thyroid gland disorder that can cause irrational and violent behavior -- and manic depression.

Everyone involved in the trial expected Schmitz to be convicted of first degree murder with a life sentence. So there was palpable shock when the jury did not convict of first degree murder, but second degree murder with a sentence of 25 years. A sentence that was soon overturned. Schmitz was tried once again in 1999, where he was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison, though he was released in 2017.

In the opening remarks of the trial of Aaron McKinney in the fall of 1999, McKinney's defense launched an all out offense on the myth of Saint Matthew in a familiar pattern of the gay panic defense. They attacked Shepherd's conduct, his lifestyle, his sexual experiences, his morals and everything else that might sway a jury. The judge refused to even entertain the notion of gay panic. And so the defense team changed strategies. They would instead argue that Matthew's murder was justified publicly announcing that he was HIV positive and therefore a danger to the entire community that he was a sexual predator. But their smears weren't sticking. For McKinney's lawyers, the greatest threat to their defense was an emerging memory of Matthew Shepard as a valued, respected and likable person.

Religious leaders also weighed in. Although they could have framed Shepard and the attack using a religious perspective, they also maintained the same secular focus and avoided any religious lan- guage. Frank Griswold, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, described Shepard as a member of “our human community” and as “our brother” and decried a national “climate of hate” that “makes such a crime possible.” He did not, unlike the president’s statement, request prayers on Shepard’s behalf, nor, as might be expected from a cleric, did Griswold mention Shepard might be in heaven. Dignity/USA, a gay Catholic organization, declared: “the murder of Matthew Shepard is an extreme example of a hate motivated crime.” Yet, it also contained no mention of prayers for the young man. An exception to this trend, however, came from the Metropolitan Community Church. Troy Perry firmly declared: “Matt has truly ‘slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.’” This image of Shepard in the presence of God, then, was the exception that proved the rule. Only Perry was willing to depart from a secular construction of Shepard to broach a religious one, although without the language of popular martyrdom. On the whole, the media and prominent public leaders — including many religious leaders — tended to cast Shepard and the attack in a secular light.<sup>25</sup>

The legacy of Matthew Shepard doesn't live on as a salacious book by a writer who first intended on writing a screenplay about the murder, though it lives on in the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in October of 2009. The measure expands the 1969 United States federal hate crimes law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.

The most significant and direct development since 1998 is passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the latest incarnation of the bill that was in Congress when Shepard died. It expands the definition of federal hate-crime law to in- clude violence committed because of the victim’s sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability. It also allows the FBI to step in where state hate-crime laws do not exist or where local law enforcement is hesitant to act. After languishing for years, held back and filibustered by conservatives, the bill was finally signed into law on October 28, 2009, by President Obama in the presence of Dennis and Judy Shepard. These events did not simply occur spontaneously as a result of Shepard’s death. Rather, they are part of an ongoing and growing awareness of gay issues in recent decades. Shepard’s popular martyrdom nonetheless did spur that awareness to greater heights, opening the door to further acceptance of gays by many other Americans.<sup>56</sup>

On February 19th, 1999, Billy Jack Gaither went to the Tavern, an Alabama nightclub where he had been friends with the owner, Marion Hammond, for 20 years. Gaither was a regular there, another regular, Steve Mullins, also started hanging out at the tavern. His presence, though, wasn't quite so benign. He sometimes showed up wearing racist t shirts and harassing African-American customers. He was known locally as a wannabe skinhead. People mentioned later that they saw Mullins and Gaither together at the bar a lot. Assuming that Gaither was talking him out of his borderline white supremacist ways, sometimes they would leave together, which made some people assume that they had a sexual relationship when in reality, Billy Jack was well known for driving his drunk friends home at the end of the night.

The judge refused to accept it. Both men were sentenced to life in prison. And in 2019, 20 years after he beat Billy Jack Gaither to death, Stephen Mullins was stabbed to death in prison. Charles Butler remains in prison. 

Ever since his death, there has been a memorial held in honor of Billy Jack on the steps of the Alabama State House. State reps and congresspeople fought for almost 20 years to have the murder of LGBT people considered a hate crime in Alabama.

The gay men have not been the only victims of the queer panic defense, often ignored by the media of the murders of trans women, especially trans women of color. Though in many cases their killers are never caught and in some cases never even really looked for. Sometimes these women's killers do end up in court where queer panic becomes the backbone of their defense. I debated whether to keep the following section in the video as transgender people begin to be acknowledged by society. They've also received the entirely wrong kind of attention, especially trans women of color.

And I cannot speak for those women. My life experience as a cisgender gay man who passes for straight is all too different. Though I have feared the wrath of homophobes from time to time. I've never had to live with the all encompassing fear of violence that so many trans women deal with every day. The murder of trans women has become all too frequent, and much like gun violence, they're rarely reported by the media.

Their deaths are left painfully vague to the point where it's easier to find information on their killers than on the women themselves. In many cases, they go unreported entirely because the police investigating the murders identify these women by their birth sex and dead names. Essentially erasing them from public record.

Just to have that taken away from them in death. A final blow from a society so unwilling to acknowledge them. I cannot begin to relate to the fear that these women live with every day.

She attended public school and a local church with family members until the controversy surrounding her trans status grew, at which time she began to withdraw socially. She stopped attending Newark Memorial High School prior to her graduation and began to look for work. She was unable to find a job, which her mother believed was the result of intolerance created by her child’s gradual transition between genders. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Murder_of_Gwen_Araujo&oldid=1056817039 Background

Gwen Araujo was born on February 24, 1985, in Brawley, California, to Edward Araujo, Sr. and Sylvia Guerrero.[6] Her parents divorced when she was 10 months old.[7]

Araujo came out as transgender in 1999 at the age of 14, and began using the name Gwen after her favorite musician, Gwen Stefani, but also went by Wendy and Lida.[8] She began to grow her hair long and planned to undergo hormone treatment and surgery.[9][10] Her older sister said that she was bullied in junior high school because of her voice and bearing. She transferred to an alternative high school, but did not return for the 2002–03 academic year.[8]

It was around this time that she met a circle of friends. The group of young adults was a mix of races and genders and enjoyed playing dominoes at the house they shared. Four men in the group Michael Madison, Josie Morrell, Yara Nabors and Jason Cazares took a particular shine to Gwen. A few weeks into the friendship, she was invited to a party they were planning.

Gwen, who was going by the name “Lida” at the time, was introduced to a circle of friends whom she met during a chance encounter while walking down a local street. The group of young adults enjoyed passing the evening hours with party activities that included playing dominos and consuming drugs and alcohol at the home of Gwen’s to-be assailants. Gwen was reported to have engaged in sexual activities with several of the men from the group. She was later invited back to the house where a party was planned a few weeks after she and the men had first met. She wore her mother’s peasant blouse to the party. Gwen’s mother had asked her not to wear the clothing she had picked out for that evening and expressed her discomfort with Gwen’s appearance. Gwen told her mother that she was just being jealous of her. This was the last time Sylvia Guerrero would see her child alive.

One of them, Madison, began choking her in the hallway of the house. People began fleeing, but Jose, Maria Elena and neighbors remained. Jason Cazares claimed to go outside at this point. However, he didn't leave because. Madison had driven him there, and apparently he couldn't fathom walking home. Inside, the three assailants continued assaulting Gwen. She was brutally beaten for 5 hours. Josie Morrell beat her over the head with a frying pan and then struck her again with a can of tomatoes. Mike Madison need her in the head against the living room wall with such force that it left an indentation in the plaster.

At the party on (October 3, 2002) it was discovered, by forced inspection (conducted by a young woman at the party), that Gwen had male genitalia. In an explosion of activity, the men that she had sexual relations with became extremely agitated. Once it was discovered that Gwen Araujo was biologically male Mike Magidson began choking Lida in the hallway of the house. At this point numerous guests left the residence. Jose Merel and Jaron Nabors remained inside the residence with Mike Magidson. Jason Cazares claimed to go outside at this point, however he did not leave because he had arrived in Mike Magidson’s truck. Once everyone left, the three assailants began assaulting her. Jose Merel struck her on the head with a frying pan and then struck again with a can of tomatoes, causing a gash to her head which bled profusely. Jaron Nabors struck her with a barbell weight. Mike Magidson kneed her in the head against the living room wall. The blow was so forceful that her head caused an indentation in the plaster wall.

Alameda County Sheriff’s Department dispatched four crime scene investigators and two detectives who recovered the body at the gravesite. The deputies were led there on 16 October 2002 by Jaron Nabors, the youngest of the four individuals charged with her murder and hate crime. The four accused of the murder were: Michael Magidson, 25, Jaron Nabors, 22, José Merél, 25 and Paul Merel, Jose’s older brother. Paul Merel was quickly released because his girlfriend (the one who checked Gwen’s genitalia in the bathroom) came forward to the police telling them that Paul had left that night with her. Paul Merel and his girlfriend were never charged and became witnesses for the prosecution. Nabors later testified against the other three in a deal with the DA for a lesser charge of manslaughter after police monitored a jailhouse letter and information gained during a conversation with one of the accused using a wiretap. Jason Cazares was arrested over a month after the other defendants and only after Nabors implicated Cazares in a letter to Nabors’ girlfriend, explaining how he (Nabors) wasn’t involved in the killing. However, Nabors would later testify that he was involved in the killing, bringing into question the reliabiltiy of the letter. Additionally, Nabors’ girlfriend testified that the letter contained numerous lies and Nabors frequently lied to her.

In their first trial, some of the defendants used a variant of the gay panic defense: the trans panic defense. Madison's defense involved an implicit acknowledgment of his role in Gwen's death, but argued that he acted in the heat of passion. The discovering that Gwen was transgender caused him to spiral into a fit of uncontrollable rage. And therefore, he should be found guilty of manslaughter, not murder, under California law. Morales attorney denied any involvement by Morrell in the killing. Cazares, the only defendant to actually testify at the first trial, denied involvement in the murder, but admitted to helping bury her. All three attacked neighbors as credibility, arguing that he minimized his own role in Gwen's death and had the most to gain by lying. The jury deadlocked on all three defendants, with the case ending in a mistrial. They were free.

Magidson’s defense involved an implicit acknowledgment of his role in Araujo’s death, but argued that Magidson acted in the heat of passion, and therefore, should be found guilty of manslaughter, not murder, under California law. Merel’s attorney denied any involvement by Merél in the killing. Cazares, the only defendant to testify at that first trial and the only defendant who never had a physical relationship with Araujo, denied involvement but admitted to help burying Araujo. Prosecution witnesses pointed out that Cazares attempted to intervene on behalf of Araujo (to stop the beating) on as many as five separate occasions prior to everyone fleeing the house. All three attacked Nabors’ credibility, arguing that he minimized his own role in Gwen’s death and had the most to gain by lying. The jury deadlocked on all three defendants, and a mistrial was recorded. The jury appeared to be unable to decide whether the murders were premeditated, and so whether to convict them of first degree murder or second degree murder. However, another possibility — one that the prosecution appeared to respond to in the second trial — was that the prosecution’s lack of a coherent theory as to who was responsible for what role in Araujo’s death made it impossible for the jurors to determine who of the three, if any, was guilty.

In contrast to the first trial, where only Cazares testified, all three defendants testified in this trial — and blamed each other as well as Nabors. However, Jose Merel conceded (like the prosecution witnesses) that Cazares intervened on behalf of Araujo during the beating. Magidson claimed to have blacked out during the beating and was unable to recall whether Cazares intervened. Cazares again claimed to be only involved in burying Araujo. No witnesses ever testified to seeing Cazares strike the victim in any manner. Jose Merél blamed Nabors as the main killer, and indicated that Magidson helped Nabors strangle Araujo to death; Merél acknowledged hitting Araujo over the head with a pan, but claimed he never wanted to kill her. Magidson also largely blamed Nabors, but also claimed to be heavily intoxicated the night of Araujo’s death. Jose Merel and Mike Magidson said that Jaron Nabors struck Gwen in the head with a barbell weight, which had not previously been disclosed. A weight from the house was brought into court and did show a presumptively positive test for blood. Nabors denied that anyone used a weight to strike Gwen. Nabors’ girlfriend also testified about the letter she received from Nabors while she was in custody. She testified that the letter contained a number of factual accounts that were lies, and that Nabors often lied to her.

Prosecutor Chris Lim Yero appeared to abandon the strategy that the prosecution employed in the first trial, blaming all three defendants equally for the crime and arguing heard only for first degree murder and instead concentrated his argument against Madison, calling him a pathetic, despicable excuse for a man.

On August 24, 2005, closing argument commenced. Prosecutor Chris Lamiero appeared to abandon the strategy that the prosecution employed in the first trial — blaming all three defendants equally for the crime and arguing hard only for first degree murder — and instead concentrated his argument against Magidson, calling him a “pathetic, despicable excuse for a man”. As for Cazares, Lamiero argued that his assistance of Magidson made him as culpable as Magidson for murder. He repeatedly referred to Cazares as “the killer’s friend” during his argument. Lamiero further appeared to concede that the murder might not be first degree murder, by arguing that the most important thing for the jury is to find Magidson and Cazares guilty of murder, either first degree or second degree. Lamiero’s closing arguments appeared to leave Merél entirely out of his fire — stating merely that Merél’s fate was up to the jury. This may be because Merél’s testimony, if believed, would tend to establish Magidson’s and Cazares’ guilt.

He indicated that the jury believed that the offense was murder rather than manslaughter because the jurors believed that Magidson and Merél’s reactions were not reasonable, but rejected the hate crime enhancement because some jurors did not believe that the crime was committed because of Araujo’s sexual orientation, but because the situation got out of hand. According to Stern, the jury convicted Magidson and Merél largely based on their admissions of their roles in Araujo’s death.

And across the street. The two other people were female, which they were. And we engaged in conversation. And I guess a friend of mine was to realize I was a good girl. I yelled out, You know, we want you as. I pushed away, you know, trying to leave. I guess you must push back. You know, I was drunk and with these, you know, that.

Dixon's attack left her comatose. Her face battered beyond recognition. She died five days later in hospital. Three days after the assault, Dixon turned himself in to the police and confessed, telling a detective that he had flown into a blind fury when he discovered that he was talking to a transgender person. The next morning, he was videotaped repeating a story for prosecutors.

Ms. Nettles died of head injuries she sustained when her head rammed into the pavement as Mr. Dixon hit her, prosecutors say. Battered beyond recognition, she was taken off life support after a week in a coma.

[...]

Three days after the assault, Mr. Dixon, of Classon Avenue in Brooklyn, turned himself in to the police and confessed, telling a detective he had flown into “a blind fury” when he discovered he was talking to a transgender woman. The next morning, he was videotaped repeating the story for prosecutors.

Confession notwithstanding, he was not indicted until March of 2015. A year and a half after the murder, despite public outcry and a personal plea from England's mother, Dolores, the state of New York refused to charge Dixon with a hate crime. Nearly three years after the murder, Dixon was finally sentenced to 12 years with the possibility of parole. When the media announced the verdict most headlines, simply read Transgender Woman's Killer Sentenced to 12 Years.

His confession notwithstanding, Mr. Dixon was not indicted until March 2015, because some witnesses had identified Paris Wilson, a casual friend of Mr. Dixon’s, as the attacker, muddying the investigation. In the end, charges were dropped against Mr. Wilson.

The New York Times. NBC News. The New York Post. The Cut Bcom. The New York Daily News. None of them put is name in the headline. Transgender woman thought she was just another dead trans woman of color whose life had been stolen. Not for anything she had done, but because of who she was. In 2020 and 20, 21 years in which most people have barely left their houses.

More trans and gender nonconforming people have been murdered in America than in any year prior. These people were killed by people they knew, people they loved and people they'd never met before. Some have been arrested and charged. Others have yet to be identified. Some of these cases involve clear transphobe women, while in others the victims where gender identity may have put them at risk due to unemployment, poverty and homelessness.

Dozens of trans people are murdered every year in the United States, and these are conservative members. The police have a tendency to misgender victims who are not ID'd or to identify them by their dead names. When They can be ID'd. So the real number of trans people lost to us each year is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.

In 2013, the American Bar Association unanimously passed a resolution imploring states to ban the use of the queer panic defense. But as of December 2021, only 11 states have done so. Though I've only discussed the queer panic defense within America. It is by no means a uniquely American problem. Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and the UK also have their own versions of the defense with varying rates of success and legality.

Many judges today reject the defense immediately, and many juries will hold it against the defense for trying to use it. There's a stigma against the defense now, even if it is still perfectly legal in 39 states. But just because jurors and judges may dismiss the use of queer panic, it's not a sure thing. The only way to ensure that justice is achieved in the murder of queer people is to enact a legislative ban on the gay and trans panic defenses, something 11 states have done.

But what of the other 39? The Biden administration should put forward a bill flat out banning the use of the defense. Do away with it once and for all to show the homophobic and transphobic, hateful bigots that know it is not okay to kill people for being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender or gender non-conforming. Our lives mean just as much as everyone else's.

You will not get away with killing us. You will not get a reduced sentence for killing us. Every year across America, people are killed for being who they are. They're killed because of the fragile masculinity of little men. Their lives ended in brutal, ugly nightmares because some their lives are worth nothing. That they won't be missed. That once they're dead and gone, their names will fade into obscurity.

Because for decades, centuries, that's what's happened. Our names were lost, our lives forgotten. But we will not forget. We cannot forget the names. Lives of the people lost to homophobia and transphobia. The sons and daughters whose parents will never see grow up. The people who have fallen to these crimes, the so-called panic. They were already taken away from US ones.

We have to make sure it doesn't happen again. So mourn their deaths and celebrate their lives, and most importantly, remember their names. Because now is the time to mourn those we've lost and fight like hell for those we've still got.
