James's patreon post about moving the video from YouTube to Vimeo:

> Hey there everyone,
> 
> I hope you're having a great weekend! So, as a lot of you know, my YouTube videos haven't been getting the same recommendations or views lately as they used to. Started around January when a lot of my videos, old ones and new ones, started getting hit with the dreaded 18+.
> 
> I've been informed by someone who actually has a manager who works with YouTube that when you have multiple 18+ videos on your channel, the algorithm stops recommending your channel to people under 18, and even stops recommending them to people over 18 who don't usually watch 18+ content. But it can possibly be fixed by deleting your 18+ stuff (unlisted and private isn't good enough). So I'm going to do that tonight.
> 
> Some of my videos that have been hit are so random, like Part 2 of the Camp video series (even though the full series as one video is perfectly fine), and yet my video about the history of gay porn (which talks about porn, underage porn, and murder) is also perfectly fine. 
> 
> Anyway!
>
> I don't want you guys going without access to the videos. They wouldn't exist without you. Hell, my channel as a whole wouldn't exist without you! So I've put them up on Vimeo and you can find the links below. Hopefully this will clear up the mess and my channel will go back to normal with the next video? Hopefully? Fingers Crossed.

Hey guys. I'm just in the process of editing the video that you're about to watch, and I thought I would drop a *severe* content warning right here. It's... it's a lot. Obviously, there's discussion of the murder of queer people. That's what the video's about. But there's also instances of audio that was taken from the killers, one of which they consistently refer to a trans woman as "he." I've made sure to keep any kind of deadnaming or anything like that out of there.

But I just wanted you to know that that's there. There's some violent shots. There's some, a couple of kind of brutal images as well, because I really wanted to get the point across. So, you know, if you feel like you need to take a break watching it or anything like that, by all means. Oh, also, for a lot of the victims, there's not a lot of pictures of them.

There's not a lot of pictures. There's not a lot of... definitely not a lot of video. So for a lot of instances, I've used shots from movies that may have been made about the case. But you'll notice a lot, especially in the last section where I'm talking about attacks on trans women, that there's very little... there's very few photos even.

And I also just really wanted to thank you all. This past year has been crazy, not just with COVID and all of that, but also for me personally, dealing with the situation with my mom and everything, and being able to make videos has been a really nice, a nice distraction.

I hope you have a really great holiday season, whatever you celebrate, and a really happy New Year. And in January, I'll be putting out a video that is not as depressing as this one. It deals with poverty, but...

On February 12th, an openly gay 15-year-old boy named Larry who was an eighth-grader in Oxnard, California was murdered by a fellow eighth-grader named Brandon. Larry was killed because he . . . was gay. Days before he was murdered, Larry asked his killer to be his Valentine . . . . And somewhere along the line the killer Brandon got the message that it’s so threatening and so awful and so horrific that Larry would want to be his Valentine that killing Larry seemed to be the right thing to do. And when the message out there is [that it is] so horrible . . . to be gay you can be killed for it, we need to change the message.

The queer panic, or better known as gay or trans panic, defense has been a legal defense tactic for three quarters of a century in the United States and abroad. <span visual={{vid}} on="38:56" off="39:05">The murder of Larry in 2008 is just a recent and particularly venomous example and may actually fall under both gay and trans panic.</span> Though Larry presented as a boy, many people who knew them stated after their death that they wanted to change their name to Latisha and possibly transition.

<span visual={{vid}} on="1:24:04" off="1:24:12">We won't know if Larry would have ever done that, though, because they only spent 15 years on this earth before rabid hatred took them from us all.</span> 

I wish Larry was the only example of this. I wish queer panic was an obscure mention in a dusty legal book somewhere. But there's a sad, dark history to this rationalization of hate masquerading as a legal defense.

<mark>While there is more acceptance of the LGBTQ community today than there was even in 2008,</mark> it's worth noting that only nine months after Larry's murder, California voted to ban gay marriage. <mark>Queer people still experience significant amounts of prejudice and discrimination.</mark> <mark>Approximately 70% of gay men and women have been the victims of verbal abuse, with 30% being the victims of physical harm,</mark> while 80% of transgender people in America have reported being physically attacked in some way. <mark>Violence against the community is a problem, even in cities with sizable queer populations.

<mark>The use of queer panic in murder cases has its roots in theories of latent homosexuality as a mental disorder. The term homosexual panic was coined by Dr. Edward Kempf, a clinical psychiatrist, in 1920. After treating many patients who exhibited similar characteristics, Kempf came to the conclusion that certain troubled individuals who thought of themselves as heterosexuals were actually latent homosexuals. These individuals suffered from an internal conflict between their feelings of attraction to people of the same sex and societal views of such feelings as perverse. They also experienced a heightened sense of anxiety in same sex environments, caused by this tension.</mark>

Kempf's study has since been used to back up the use of the queer panic defense that latent homosexuality is in and of itself a mental disorder, therefore excusing the defendant as being not in control of their own faculties. By using the gay panic defense, they are essentially admitting to be latently queer themselves. A nuance many of the defendants, I'm sure, are unaware of. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.cynthia_lee at="p.484-485" %}>

Even if some self-identified straight men who express strongly negative feelings about homosexuality are actually latent homosexuals repressing their own homoerotic desires, the idea that gay panic should excuse the killing of a gay man is problematic for several reasons. First, treating gay panic as a mental disorder suggests that homophobia<sup>50</sup> linked to latent homosexuality is a mental illness.<sup>51</sup> Studies, however, indicate that negative attitudes about homosexuality tend to come from two sources: sexual conservatism and prejudice.<sup>52</sup> Although some mental health practitioners might feel otherwise,<sup>53</sup> sexually conservative individuals and prejudiced individuals are not necessarily mentally ill.

<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

James seems to be taking the "latent homosexuality is a mental illness" fragment and running with it. First of all, that wasn't Kempf's study, it was Henry Adams' study, Kempf just had theories based on his practice. Second of all, the study, which was from 1996, has not been used to argue that "latent homosexuality is a mental illness," because homosexual panic and homosexuality have not been considered mental disorders, at least in the DSM, since the early 70s. [Homosexual panic, as a disorder, and the homosexual panic defense, are distinct, because a person using the homosexual panic defense is typically arguing *temporary* insanity (or provocation or self defense), not that they have a mental illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense#Use_of_the_gay_panic_defense). I guess you *could* argue that people who use the gay panic defense are admitting to being latently queer, based on the term's origin, but that's really a stretch, and it's pretty homophobic to imply that everyone who uses the gay panic defense is gay themselves. Or maybe he's just saying it's ironic that a heterosexual homophobe is accidentally admitting to being gay, I don't know.

Gay panic in and of itself is a useless defense. It must be attached to something more meaty, something you can win over a jury with.

<u>[Title Card]: A <span style="color:red">|</span></u> <mark>Excuse or justification</mark>

<mark>An excuse defense is one in which the defendant's conduct is viewed as wrongful, but that he himself is not seen as morally at fault. A justification defense, on the other hand, focuses on the defendant's conduct more than his individual characteristics. A justification defense argues that the attacker's conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.</mark>

<mark>*A. Excuse or Justification?*</mark>

A preliminary question is whether gay panic, if allowed as a defense argument, should be recognized as an excuse or a justification. <mark>An excuse defense is one in which the actor's conduct is viewed as wrongful, but the actor himself is not seen as morally blameworthy.<sup>75</sup> A justification defense, in contrast, focuses on the actor's conduct more than the individual characteristics of the actor.<sup>76</sup> A justification defense says the actor's conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.<sup>77</sup></mark> Examples of excuse defenses include insanity, duress, and intoxication. Necessity, self-defense, and defense of others are usually considered justification defenses.

Truthfully, <mark>it's difficult to argue that queer panic should be called either a justification or an excuse. Justification suggests the defendant did the right thing in killing the victim, that he did what society would have wanted him to do.</mark> And <mark>an excuse defense suggests that the killer is not as morally blameworthy</mark> <mark>as he would have been had he killed a straight man or a cisgender woman.</mark> Both, in my humble opinion, are bullshit. <mark fc=false>Even most defense attorneys know that, so they very rarely try to argue for either justification or excuse.</mark>

<mark>It is difficult to argue that gay panic should be called either a justification or an excuse.

<mark>An excuse defense suggests that the defendant is not as morally blameworthy</mark> as one who does the same action without the excusing condition.

No, attorneys *have* to argue excuse or justification, or they're not going to get anywhere with a gay panic defense. The text literally says that out of the gay panic defense arguments, "provocation is a partial excuse defense, self-defense is a justification defense, and insanity and diminished capacity are excuse defenses."

<mark>There are several problems with defense attempts to claim insanity linked to gay panic. First to be found NGI, not guilty by insanity, a defendant must not have understood the nature of his act or appreciated that what he was doing was wrong.

They do have one other option though:

The pair were friends with both Kerouac and Burroughs, who both reportedly had a crush on the young Carr. He was like a magnet for men struggling with their sexualities, not just Kammerer, Kerouac and Burroughs, but Allen Ginsberg as well.

Once in custody, Carr told police that over the years of their acquaintance, Kammerer had several times made improper advances to him, but that he had always rebuffed the older man. 

<mark>The phrase "improper advances" was not new to crime stories in the 1940s. Since the late 19th century, such terms were common in the press to describe verbal and physical assaults on women.

James changes first-degreee to second-degree, presumably because the Medium article says "he pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter." I looked but I couldn't find which one he actually pleaded. I suspect it was first-degree manslaughter because it makes more sense from what I read about New York laws; second-degree manslaughter, also called reckless homicide, is when you unintentionally cause someone else's death through reckless behavior, while first-degree manslaughter is when you intentionally kill someone while in a state of "extreme emotional disturbance."

Carr served only two years in a reformatory. Whether Kammerer was a sexual predator, murdered in self-defense or Carr was mentally unstable, have both been argued ever since. Not long before the murder, Carr tried committing suicide by putting his head in an oven which he later swore was performance art. And Kammerer did have a habit of popping up wherever Carr was, no matter how many times he moved.

The facts in this case are elastic, with too many contradicting stories over the last seven decades. But wherever the truth may lie, one thing is for sure, though the gay panic defense was not *technically* used in this case, its seeds were planted in the honor killing defense. The ability to more or less get away with murder if you felt threatened by someone's sexuality, making the victim into the monster.

It became tabloid fodder and even drew the attention of conservatives in the federal government, who had been zeroing in on the LGBT community for decades. In the 1950s, during Joseph McCarthy's Red Scare, more gay men were fired from government jobs than suspected communists. The so-called Lavender Scare among lawmakers, lawyers and judges easily transformed into gay panic.

<comment id="todd_1" {% include commenter video=todd at="4590" %}>

So it is true that after 14 years in prison, Parisie did win his appeal in 1982, partially because of the suppressed witnesses. However, this quote right here, the one where the judge calls the dead gay man a pervert and said his perversions would have led to an acquittal - I am almost certain that this quote is *completely fabricated*. It does *not* appear in the source he's pulling from, and it does not appear in any of the court rulings, of which there were several. It's possible that I just don't know my way around legal documents well enough to find the source of this quote, but also just on basic logic, I don't buy it. The gay Panic defense is used to get *leniency*, not acquittal. Somerton says that himself earlier in the video. 

And it's definitely not likely that Parisie would have been acquitted. Parisie said beforehand that he was gonna go quote "roll a queer" because he needed the money, and when he was arrested, he was in possession of the victim's wallet, wedding ring, and car. Plus, the prosecutor debunked "gay panic" as made up anyway, so even with the testimony, I don't buy that he would have been acquitted. A judge did not say that. [On screen: "The problem with quotes found on the Internet is that they are often not true." - Abraham Lincoln ] 

Finally, I did consult with some lawyers about these court documents - thank you Devin LegalEagle and @jewishlawyerlib on Twitter - and based on what they told me, I think the entire conclusion of this segment is wrong. That's not Somerton's fault, the source he's using misinterpreted the case, but what actually happened was: Parisie won the right to a *retrial* in 1982. Not his freedom, just a retrial.However, the state appealed that ruling and a year later the court changed its mind based on like, minor procedural stuff, like Parisie missed a filing deadline somewhere along the line. So, the first appeal was overturned and the original guilty verdict stood; Parisie did not get his retrial. 

And again that's not Somerton's fault, his source was wrong, but the embellishments he added, those *do* belong to him, and they make the initial error much worse. The prosecutor had argued that the victim probably wasn't even gay, and one appeals judge thought, if you're gonna call this guy a liar, he has the right to prove you wrong. If you think there were maybe some biased undertones to that decision, you know what, go ahead and make that case, but the decision was about the right to a fair trial, not whether it's okay to murder "perverts." He's once again fabricating evidence to support someone else's conclusion, which in this case wasn't even valid.

Also, Reggie (and then James) claims that Parisie was convicted for manslaughter, but none of the records of the case I could find mentioned manslaughter, only murder. It wouldn't make sense anyway; manslaughter wouldn't get a 40 to 70 year sentence, the sentence length that Reggie claims.

Over the next twenty years, the gay panic defense was used regularly<sup cn></sup> in American courtrooms, but not just in the murder of gay men.

As Cynthia Lee states, the gay panic defense generally did not work as a temporary insanity plea (491-494). I'm not sure if there's even one case of it working as a temporary insanity plea, though there were cases of it working as a diminished capacity plea.

[James is exaggerating *far* beyond what actually happened in the civil trial.](https://www.courttv.com/title/56-amedure-v-jenny-jones-allyn-schmitz-pt3/) Schmitz's father was homophobic and he was angry about the Jenny Jones incident.

LGBT advocate groups fought hard to bring attention to the legally unsound gay panic defense that had been utilized, but people simply weren't interested. It had only been a few years since the supposedly liberal Clinton administration had banned gay men from serving in the military and banned same sex marriage federally, to high approval ratings among the American public. In the late 1990s, there was far more sympathy for those who murdered queer people than there was for the queer people being murdered. A sad reality... that was about to be shaken one night in Laramie, Wyoming.

</james>
<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

Clinton's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy also banned out lesbians and bisexual people, as well as openly gay men, from serving in the military; I'm not sure why James is specifying gay men, it wasn't specific to gay men. Maybe he thinks women weren't in the military at that time, but they definitely were. And LGBT people couldn't serve in the miliitary before DADT either.

Clinton's Defense of Marriage Act prevented federal recognition of same sex marriage and allowed states to refuse to recognize same sex marriages performed in other states. The way James phrases it, it sounds like he thinks that it banned same sex marriage everywhere in the country, which it did not.

This was not your typical gay bashing in the media's eyes. Matthew's boyish good looks, radiant smile and almost angelic presence allowed them to portray him as more than just another murdered queer.

In the opening remarks of the trial of Aaron McKinney in the fall of 1999, McKinney's defense launched an all-out offense on the myth of Saint Matthew. In a familiar pattern of the gay panic defense, they attacked Shepard's conduct, his lifestyle, his sexual experiences, his morals and everything else that might sway a jury. The judge refused to even entertain the notion of gay panic. And so the defense team changed strategies - <mark fc=false>they would instead argue that Matthew's murder was justified, publicly announcing that he was HIV positive and therefore a danger to the entire community, that he was a sexual predator.</mark> But their smears weren't sticking. For McKinney's lawyers, the greatest threat to their defense was an emerging memory of Matthew Shepard as a valued, respected and likable person.

I am certain that Somerton made up the part about "Matthew's murder was justified" - I found no record of such a "defense" being used, and I'm sure it would have been a big deal if it had been used. The Westboro protesters were saying those things, not the defense attorneys. I'm not sure if most of the earlier attacks on Shepard (minus accusing Shepard of propositioning McKinney) actually happened either; from what I read of the trial, the defense mostly focused on explaining how McKinney's drug and alcohol use and trauma from sexual abuse led to him "snapping" when Shepard supposedly propositioned him, and that he hadn't intended to kill him when he beat him. It is true, though, that a gay panic defense was made and the judge refused to consider it. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov99/shepard110199.htm) (https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/hatecrimes/stories/shepard102699.htm)

According to the podcast, Steven Butler asked Billy to give him a ride to The Tavern, while Charles Mullins was at a pool tournament at a different bar. Steven went back and forth between the two bars a couple times and talked to Charles about the murder plan at some point, then Billy picked them both up at the other bar when the tournament was over. The police were at The Tavern, so they went to Charles' house instead.

Sometimes these women's killers do end up in court, where queer panic becomes the backbone of their defense.

I debated whether to keep the following section in the video. As transgender people begin to be acknowledged by society, they've also received the entirely wrong kind of attention, especially trans women of color. And I cannot speak for those women. My life experience as a cisgender gay man who passes for straight is all too different. Though I have feared the wrath of homophobes from time to time, I've *never* had to live with the all-encompassing fear of violence that so many trans women deal with every day.

The murder of trans women has become all too frequent, and much like gun violence, they're rarely reported by the media. Their deaths are left painfully vague, to the point where it's easier to find information on their killers... than on the women themselves. In many cases, they go unreported entirely because the police investigating the murders identify these women by their birth sex and deadnames, essentially erasing them from public record. These women fight to be accepted for who they truly are in life, just to have that taken away from them in death - a final blow from a society *so* unwilling to acknowledge them.

I cannot begin to relate to the fear that these women live with every day - that a sideways glance from a man on the street might mean their death. But I know so many women deal with this fear on a daily basis, and so many others aren't here anymore to tell us about it. And so I decided that though I may be an imperfect messenger, that I need to tell their stories so that more people will know their names.

No witnesses ever testified to seeing Cazares strike the victim in any manner. Jose Merél blamed Nabors as the main killer, and indicated that Magidson helped Nabors strangle Araujo to death; Merél acknowledged hitting Araujo over the head with a pan, but claimed he never wanted to kill her. Magidson also largely blamed Nabors, but also claimed to be heavily intoxicated the night of Araujo’s death. Jose Merel and Mike Magidson said that Jaron Nabors struck Gwen in the head with a barbell weight, which had not previously been disclosed. A weight from the house was brought into court and did show a presumptively positive test for blood. Nabors denied that anyone used a weight to strike Gwen. Nabors’ girlfriend also testified about the letter she received from Nabors while she was in custody.

This is what led her to Allen Andrade. Her murder was, in a rare occurrence at the time, immediately taken seriously by the police, though it was less likely because of her gender identity and more likely the fact that Andrade had a criminal background and they could put a known offender behind bars.

Unlike many transgender women who disappear or are murdered, Angie had not been abandoned by her family. She was deeply loved by them and her countless friends. People loved her immediately upon meeting her. She was, as some described after her death, a sweet soul whose greatest ambition was to be happy and help others. Angie is sorely missed, most by her mother, but by friends and family as well, by coworkers and acquaintances. 

But she'll always be remembered, not just as the sweet soul that she was in life, but in the lingering impact of her death, being the first time that the murder of a trans woman was tried as a hate crime and saw a successful conviction. That she cracked that already shaky bedrock on which the trans panic defense rests... though it was far from shattered.

<mark>Confession notwithstanding, he was not indicted until March of 2015,</mark> a year and a half after the murder. Despite public outcry and a personal plea from Islan's mother, Dolores, the state of New York refused to charge Dixon with a hate crime.

When the media announced the verdict, most headlines simply read, "Transgender Woman's Killer Sentenced to 12 Years." *The New York Times*, *NBC News*, *The New York Post*, *The Cut.com*, *The New York Daily News* -  none of them put Islan's name in the headline.

Dozens of trans people are murdered every year in the United States, and these are conservative numbers. The police have a tendency to misgender victims who are not ID'd, or to identify them by their deadnames when they can be ID'd. So the real number of trans people lost to us each year is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.

<mark>In 2013, the American Bar Association unanimously passed a resolution imploring states to ban the use of the queer panic defense.</mark> But as of December 2021, only <mark fc=false>eleven states</mark> have done so. 

Though I've only discussed the queer panic defense within America. It is by no means a uniquely American problem. Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and the UK also have their own versions of the defense with varying rates of success and legality.

Many judges today reject the defense immediately, and many juries will hold it against the defense for trying to use it. There's a stigma against the defense now, even if it is still perfectly legal in <mark fc=false>39 states.</mark> But just because jurors and judges may dismiss the use of queer panic, it's not a sure thing.

James seems to be skimming the Wikipedia article for the rest of this section. He's not very good at it though, because in December 2021 there were more than 11 states that had banned some version of the gay panic defense. It's possible that, like before, he is still referring to an earlier version of the article despite having updated the date to December 2021, or he just read "In July 2020, Colorado became the 11th US state to abolish the gay panic defense" and just didn't look any closer. Anyway, in December 2021, according to the Wikipedia article, 15 states had banned the gay/trans panic defense, plus the District of Columbia. [As of June 2024, it's now 19 states.](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/panic_defense_bans), with Minnesota being the most recent state to pass such a law.

The Biden administration should put forward a bill flat out banning the use of the defense. Do away with it once and for all to show the homophobic and transphobic, hateful bigots that no, it is not okay to kill people for being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender or gender non-conforming. Our lives mean just as much as everyone else's. You will not get away with killing us. You will not get a reduced sentence for killing us.

Every year across America, people are killed for being who they are. They're killed because of the fragile masculinity of little men. Their lives ended in brutal, ugly nightmares because some believe their lives are worth nothing. That they won't be missed. That once they're dead and gone, their names will fade into obscurity.

Because for decades, centuries, that's what's happened. Our names were lost, our lives forgotten. But we will not forget. We cannot forget the names of the lives of the people lost to homophobia and transphobia, the sons and daughters whose parents will never see grow up. The people who have fallen to these crimes, the so-called queer panic, they were already taken away from us once. We have to make sure it doesn't happen again. 

So mourn their deaths and celebrate their lives, and most importantly, remember their names. Because now is the time to mourn those we've lost and fight like hell for those we've still got.
