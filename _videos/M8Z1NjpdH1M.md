<u>[Fade up on video]</u>

Mankind has always found an innate horror in things that are different. An evolutionary reflex to protect itself from the things that may be dangerous to them or their loved ones. <mark fc=false>Eons ago, human beings found *Homo erectus* to be terrifying, because it was different. Leading to their assumed extinction.</mark>

</james>
<comment id="homo_erectus">
{% include header for=tustin %}

This is a whole lot of speculation with nothing to back it up. For one, "Homo erectus" ***is*** a "human being", in that scientists classify them as [one of the "human species"](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/homo-erectus-our-ancient-ancestor.html#:~:text=H.%20erectus%20is%20the%20longest%20lived%20of%20all%20human%20species). And we have no way of knowing if other species of early humans found them terrifying.

And, the current going theory as to why they went extinct was [due to climate change](https://www.insidescience.org/news/final-days-homo-erectus) and not, as is implied here, other humans being terrified of them and killing them.

This is not entirely unlike the reaction toward homosexuality from the heterosexual majority. Something different. Something strange. Something queer. Something that goes against what they believe to be the natural order of things. And that in and of itself is the initial seed of horror. Being afraid of things you do not understand, things that do not belong, creatures and events that go against your own survival needs. A son or daughter that bears no children could possibly lead to the end of your lineage. And what else do you exist for other than to procreate?

In the days and years before the rise of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, what was there to civilization but creating the next generation of people? And homosexuals both men and women *could* (theoretically) put a stop to that. And so it can be assumed that from the very beginning of time homosexuality was looked at as not just a societal other... but a danger to mankind itself.

Though like many things existing before the written word, this proved to be untrue, this idea (along with other fanciful creations of pre-history) has survived into the modern age. The notion of homosexuality as a danger to mankind as a whole has been disproven time and time again. But sometimes ancient teachings are hard to be forgotten.

And so the queer entered into the horror canon. Centuries before hollywood even existed, before horror movies graced the silver screen, before the works of Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley sent chills down reader spines... before the people of Salem burned those accused of being witches alive. Before even the murder of Saint Sebastian.

James, [in a pinned comment](https://archive.is/VfDwQ#selection-7449.0-7449.232) shortly after the video went up: 

> Many many people have now made me aware that witches were not burned in Salem, only in Europe lol. Sorry for the mistake. My family comes from Scotland and Russia so Ive only ever heard stories of witches being burned my whole life.

The fear of the unknown, <mark fc=false>according to the American Psychological Association</mark>, is one of the most prominent causes for anxiety among people in both the first and third world.

The closest source found was [this citation](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-17121-001) of an [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887618516300469) that talks about fear of the unknown being a fundamental fear. It does not appear to make any claims about fear of the unknown being the most prominent causes for anxiety in any part of the world. The paper *does* posit that the fear of the unknown is possibly a fundamental fear that underlies anxiety, but it doesn't claim that this fear causes a diagnosis of anxiety.

First of all he omits the author name, second it was NOT published by the APA, but instead Elsevier. I assume he read the summary from this website and immediately thought if it's from the APA website APA wrote it.

It accounts for the hatred toward anything existing outside the norm. In bathroom laws across the United States, in the banning of immigrants, in the murder of non-white people, in the remaining animosity toward homosexuals, and anyone looked at as queer.

<summary>His claim is shaky at best: Queer people existed in Egypt, but there's not a lot of info on them. If pharaohs and queens had same-gender consorts, it's not recorded. And the only "transgender pharaoh" we have info on is Hatshepsut, who is not actually transgender, but rather wanted to be a pharaoh and not a queen, and "pharaoh" is a male-gendered title.</summary>

> First off, there is actually pretty scarce firsthand of homosexuality in ancient Egypt. Scholars are pretty sure it existed, I do believe that one pharaoh ([Pepi II Neferkare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Neferkare_and_General_Sasenet)) was referred to as going to one of his general's house and "doing as he desired," but to say that they were multiple gay pharaohs isn't really supported. Also Nefekare had multiple female consorts, but chalk that up to James just using "gay" as an umbrella term. (edit: Also, I realized that James specified "gay and bisexual" with the Romans in the following sentence, which casts a weird light on this.)
> 
> I think the general consensus is "Same sex relationships existed, they didn't write about the much, but there's nothing condemning them, so they probably were chill with it." The only thing close to condemning a lesbian relationship is one woman writing that she didn't have sex with another priestess in a temple as proof of her doing virtuous things, ([source](https://medium.com/the-collector/tracing-homosexuality-1d2c0dbab7a2#:~:text=I%20never%20had%20sex%20with%20a%20woman%20in%20the%20temple)) but the "in the temple" is probably the most important part here, and it was just "don't have sex with people in a sacred area." There's the burial of [Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khnumhotep_and_Niankhkhnum), who were probably a same sex couple in ancient Egypt in the Old Kingdom. They both had wives and children, but were buried together and multiple paintings in their tomb depict them in positions that you would also see a married couple (ex: touching noses.) We don't know if their wives were also in that tomb, because it was looted long ago. There's a statue of two women named [Idet and Ruiu](https://collezioni.museoegizio.it/en-GB/material/Cat_3056), depicted in a pose that is most common with married couples, but the inscription doesn't say anything about their relationship. Same sex marriage didn't exist in ancient Egypt to our knowledge, but if you viewed marriage as a legal joining for the purpose of children, why would you bother getting married? You could just live with your partner (presumably)
> 
> I don't think there's any evidence of a queen in a relationship with another woman.
> 
> tl;dr: Queer people existed in ancient Egypt, there's not a lot of info on them, and multiple pharaohs and queens being openly gay isn't attested to. Maybe they did have consorts of the same gender, but it's not recorded.
> 
> The "transgender pharaohs" bit I'm 99.9% sure is referring to Hatshepsut.
> 
> This is probably just James seeing that Hatshepsut depicted herself wearing the regalia of a male pharaoh (including a fake beard) in sculptures, and extrapolating that she must have been a trans man.
> 
> This is not really supported by any other evidence of Hatshepsut, especially the stuff that was created by Hatshepsut.
> 
> Pharaoh was a male title. The "uniform" (ex: beard and headdress) was for men. Hatshepsut didn't wear female pharaoh regalia because such a thing did not exist, and she wanted to be known as a pharaoh, not as a queen.
> 
> In all work commissioned by Hatshepsut, she refers to herself in the feminine. She emphasizes how she is her father's daughter. In fact, she was "rediscovered" by Egyptologists because the pharaoh who tried to erase her from history replaced her name with a man's name, but when one of the Egyptologists, Jean-François Champollion, was translating Hieroglyphs on one of her temple walls he noted:
> 
> > If I felt somewhat surprisd at seeing here, as elsewhere throughout the temple, the renowned Moeris (Thutmose), adorned with all the insignia of royalty, giving place to this Amenenthe, for whose name we may search the royal lists in vain, still more astonished was I to find on reading the inscriptions that wherever they referred to this bearded king in the usual dress of the Pharaohs, nouns and verbs were in the feminine, as though a queen were in question. I found the same peculiarity everywhere. Not only was there the prenomen on Amenenthe preceded by the title of sovereign ruler of the world, WITH THE FEMININE AFFIX, but also his own name immediately following on the title of "Daughter of the Sun". Finally, in all the bas-reliefs representing the gods speaking to this king, he is addressed as a queen, as in the following formula: "Behold, thus saith Amen-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the World, to his daughter whom he loves, sun devoted to the truth: the building which thou hast made is like to the divine dwelling."

<details>
<summary>There were <em>many</em> Greek philosophers who were possibly bisexual, though, they didn't have the concept of sexual identities back then, and assigning such identities to them steamrolls a lot of nuance.</summary>

> There were cultural associations between philosophy and pederasty--the cultural practice of man-boy couples (archetypally, although ages varied) involving both education and sexual favors. The main example is Plato, who famously defended male-male erotic love in Symposium as a starting point for greater philosophical virtues. Zeno of Citium was also a habitual pederast. Others (like Bion of Borysthenes, Theodorus of Cyrene, etc) said positive things about pederasty and boy-love, but we generally don't have actual biographical information about whether they were habitual pederasts or not .
> 
> (There were also notable exceptions, like the Cynics: Diogenes (and I think Crates, although I can't find the reference rn) expressed disdain for youths beautifying themselves for luxurious pederastic relationships (6.46-7))
> 
> Pederasty was a fairly common practice across certain areas ancient Greece, especially in the upper class from which most philosophers came. So there's a decent chance that a lot of philosophers participated in their youth or later on. But given the lack of specific biographical references to homosexuality for some of them and the institutionalized nature of pederasty in some city-states, it's hard to see this as strong proof of most philosophers' gayness (especially in the contemporary identity-focused sense of the term).
> 
> The Romans also negatively associated Greek philosophers and Greek culture in general with homosexuality (see Juvenal 2.4-15, Lucian Dialogues of the Courtesans 10), the idea being that teaching students philosophy was just a pretext for lust.
> 
> **TLDR**: James has the right idea about homosexuality and ancient Greek philosophy, and the claim that "most" philosophers had sexual relationships with other males may very well be true. I don't think there's enough evidence to say "most" for certain, but "many" is definitely true.
> 
> With that said, we should be cautious about assigning "gayness": most ancient Greeks probably didn't have the same idea of sexual orientation as an identity like we do. James with his sweeping transcultural claims ("For millenia, homosexuality and gender fluidity were not things to fear, but things to embrace, if not celebrate.") has no such qualms and thus steamrolls over nuances like the fact that Greek pederasty was a site of contention in the 5th century BCE and onward (see [Lear (2018) "Was Pederasty Problematized: A Diachronic View"](https://www.academia.edu/10420267/Was_pederasty_problematized_A_diachronic_answer)).

[His take on early Christianity] Isn't correct. The early church father and Christian authorities unanimously condemned homosexuality. He might have taken this from John Boswell, but this is disputed by religious scholars.

It's an incredibly vague take too. Which early Christians were accepting of homosexuality? There were like, several dozen Christian sects and cults running around during the early days of Christianity, most of which did not survive into modernity, you got to get specific if you want to make that point.

Along with the dark ages came a great tumult that led to the fear of anything and anyone non-Christian. Women became witches, gay men became warlocks, and the very idea of homosexuality was attributed to demonic possession, if not from Satan himself, than from the pagan deities that lingered and swept down from the north.

And that is where our story of gay horror picks up. Hundreds of years later, with a coven of witches.

</james>
<comment id="medieval">
{% include header for=tustin %}

The term "warlock" means "male witch" only in modern times. It means ["oath-breaker"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlock#Etymology_and_terminology) (as in breaking your oath to god) in Old English, and thus would be gender-neutral. "Witch" is similarly gender-neutral in Old English, [having male and female forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(word)#Etymology).

Also, though it may have happened occasionally, it doesn't look like attributing being gay to "demonic possession" was a widespread thing, [instead just being a sin and looked down upon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Catholic_Church_and_homosexuality).

Being released the same year the Defense of Marriage act was put in place, and only two years after the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy was passed, *The Craft* became an instant hit, and a cult sensation, that would be played at gay halloween parties for literally decades to come. 

As mentioned before, the connection between witches and homosexuality has gone back centuries, if not millennia. Lesbians were accused of witchcraft more than any other group of women.

Based on the best-selling novel by queer ally Stephen King, *Carrie* tells the story of Carrie white, A teenage girl trying desperately to make it through her high school years. she's bullied for being a bit different, for being shy, for not fitting in, and like many young Christians, doesn't feel at home in the stifling environment of an evangelical household.

Carrie has a crush, you see, on the high school heartthrob, Tommy. and like many a gay boy and girl in their high school years, he is completely unattainable, until he's not. until he's suddenly interested in Carrie, a predicament both thrilling and terrifying. How many queer high schoolers have been in that position? Having a crush on a boy or girl, thinking there's no way that they could possibly be into you, that they're most likely straight. Approaching them romantically may even end in violence, especially in the 1970s, when the book and movie came out. This can easily be placed on most high schoolers who feel like they don't fit in but, it's particularly salient for queer kids. 

I myself had a crush in junior high, we'll call him "Dan". He knew I was gay and seemed relatively accepting. but the ever-existing caveat "but I'm not gay, so you know, don't try anything" always hovered over the friendship. I knew there was no chance. And then, one night, my friends and I were having a movie night. Six of us were piled into my room watching Bram Stoker's Dracula, itself full of queer imagery. And while most everyone had spread out around the room, Dan and I ended up in my bed. A single bed with barely enough room for me, let alone another six foot soccer player. He didn't seem to mind though. Nothing happened between us, of course, but knowing that my straight best friend was okay practically cuddling with me made me pretty happy.

No such luck for Carrie White though. Or most queer kids. After much bullying, even by characters not coded strictly as villains, Carrie is invited to the prom the epitome of high school heteronormativity. Not just invited, but invited by the most all-American crush she could possibly have, the epitome of the high school crush archetype. Not of his own volition, mind you, but by the cajoling of his girlfriend Sue, who seems to be the only decent person in the entire school.

But Carrie doesn't know that. She gets to believe, for just a little while, that a boy like that could really like her. And to make it all that much better, the rabid bitch who's been making her high school life a living hell won't even be there, thanks to the help of a coded lesbian gym teacher. Eventually voted prom queen, Carrie's on top of the world.

And then the rug is pulled out from under her. A bucket of pig's blood is pulled from the rafters coating her head to toe. And suddenly the realization hits. The fear that every queer kid holds down deep inside, that they'll be accepted lauded even, just for it all to be one big practical joke. Pranks like these are not uncommon. There's a reason every outsider in high school fears them. Pig's blood usually isn't involved, but raising up an oddball student to the very highest of heights just to push them off at the edge... It does happen.

This is when most would run off the stage in horror and shame, hide from the people who did this. But not Carrie. Not unlike the videos we see of high school kids fighting back against their bullies, Carrie strikes back in a vicious and bloody attack... that leaves the prom coded in even more blood than she. 

Fires rage around the gymnasium as she makes her way through it, a revenge fantasy for every teenager who has ever been othered, made fun of, bullied, attacked, held down. Carrie's a horror to mainstream audiences, terrified of the other. But a hero to queer kids and everyone who doesn't fit in, a literal horror superhero.

Of course, in the end, from my point of view anyway, Carrie is all about shame. Much like the shame of gay teenagers in certain types of families, certain kinds of home towns, not fitting in, being ostracized even when you try to fit in, and this shame is personified by Carrie White. Gay audiences form a connection with Carrie unlike with most horror heroines. She is the internalized anxiety within us, the yearning to be something more, to fit in, and yet be ourselves. To not be bullied, or at least to fight back against the bully. 

But we're not all Carrie White. Sometimes that self-hatred internalizes, something dark and morbid roiling within our bodies. A demon ravaging our very soul.

And so he searches out an infernal <mark>puzzle box</mark> that, when <mark>solved, summons interdimensional beings</mark> known as <mark>the Cenobites</mark>, creatures that <mark>dwell in a realm of extreme carnal indulgence, where people</mark> are willingly subjected <mark>to severe forms of sadomasochism that include, but are surely not limited to, being torn apart by hooks and chains.</mark>

<mark>Clearly this amalgamation of pleasure and pain is extremely hyperbolized for the sake of horror, but it doesn't feel too far off from the way queer people in the BDSM community are often perceived by those who don't understand that subculture.</mark>

The queer BDSM culture of the time welcomed *Hellraiser* with open arms, indulging in its allegorical portrayal of kink, polyamory, and queerness. This subgroup of the LGBT community grew quickly in the 1980s as a way to experience sexual pleasure that didn't involve penile penetration, avoiding HIV by learning a whole new way of enjoying pleasure. And pain. And to many in the queer community, they were looked at as freaks, monsters, horrors to be avoided at any cost. 

what does it mean to be considered a monster... by monsters?

Clive Barker is an openly gay author, painter and film director, but while elements of his novels are celebrated for their queerness, it often seems that his films are regarded not as queer; they are simply films that happen to be made by a gay man. <mark>Even in Harry M. Benshoff’s</mark> somewhat exhaustive study <em><mark>Monsters in the Closet</mark>: Homosexuality and the Horror Film</em> <mark>Barker remains a somewhat marginal figure</mark>. <mark>Benshoff recognizes *Hellraiser* for some of its visual characteristics, but comes to the conclusion that “too often the representation of Barker’s monster queers seems similar to those produced by right-wing ideologues.</mark>” <sup>3</sup>

<mark>Benshoff’s book bases itself on the theories put forward by Robin Wood in the late 1970s. In a series of essays, Wood examined the ways in which horror films reflect</mark> the surplus <mark>repression in contemporary society</mark>. This serious study of a genre, one which has generally been regarded as something almost anti-intellectual, <mark>attempts to shine a light on the shapes that lurk in the</mark> darkness <mark>, and the way that the introduction of the Monster disrupts society. According to Wood, the basic formula of the horror film is that “normality is threatened by the Monster.”</mark> <sup>4</sup> This equation simplifies the engine that propels the horror film into the parts of the collective psyche that we’d seldom willingly explore, and allows for a discussion on how the genre may be used as a podium to express political ideas that fall far outside the mainstream.

When he returns to Earth to resurrect his long abandoned flesh, he intends to kill innocent people to make it happen. Frank *the man*... is the monster.

The hell priest, eventually christened "Pinhead" by fans, though Barker loathes the name, is not a mindless killer, like Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers. He's not a killer of innocents, like Freddy Krueger. He is reasonable and only comes when called, keeps to himself in his own realm, much like the queer community that lived in cities and was not infiltrating suburbs, as so many white americans feared in the late 1980s. Though he and his fellow Cenobites would grow closer to their slasher brethren as the *Hellraiser* series went on, in the original, he is not the monster to be feared. The perfectly normal *person* was.

One scene shows the uncomfortable simultaneous acts of Jennifer seducing a soon-to-be victim while Needy makes love to her bumbling boyfriend. Looking at the scene through the eye of a film editor, it's easy enough to see what's happening: Jennifer is the aggressor in her scene, while Needy is the submissive partner in hers. 

The cutting back and forth can easily be read as an editing trick to make the mind see Jennifer and Needy having sex.

To me there's a very interesting reading of *Jennifer's Body*: that queer teenage girls whose sexualities are only starting to bloom can easily become confused about their relationships with other girls. Straight girls and women have much closer more intimate relationships than straight boys and men. If you see two girls holding hands, you might not think anything of it. If you see a girl running her hand through another girl's hair, she's probably just trying to help her relax. Kiss on the cheek, or even lips, that's nothing. If you hear two women say "I love you", you don't immediately think "lesbians". While there is a much stricter code of conduct for men and boys: no hand holding, no hugs that last for too long, and a kiss or an "I love you", even between fathers and sons, absolutely not.

And so there's a bit of gay male privilege there: if another boy or man is acting very close and intimate, the assumption can be made that he's, at the very least not homophobic, and quite possibly open to something more. The situation is easier to read because there are so many barriers put up between men. A possible upside to toxic masculinity.

Of course, these are not representative of what defines womanhood in real life, but in media predominantly created by men, these were the usual binaries on show.

Again, this would suggest that gender standards have evolved in the future, as Drake’s relationship with Vasquez is never questioned by anyone else as anything but normal.

Finally, there’s <mark>Bishop</mark>, the <mark>“artificial person”</mark> who is gendered as male but has no real sex. The very fact that he requests to be called a more politically correct version of his kind codes him as being a minority. One might assume he’s a stand-in for African Americans during the Jim Crow years, as he’s treated as a servant in a lower tier of society. But considering his soft voice and gentle mannerisms, it’s more fitting that he’s an analog for a gay man.

As <mark>David Greven explains in “</mark>[<mark num="">Demeter and Persephone in Space</mark>: Transformation, Femininity and Myth in the Alien Films](https://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc52.2010/GrevenAliens/3.html)“:

<mark>The deaths of Newt and Hicks</mark>, as painful as they were, is actually <mark>central to this message.</mark> The scariest thing about <mark>AIDS (in Alien 3) is that it seems to kill almost randomly</mark> -- it doesn't matter if you are an <mark>innocent like Newt</mark> or a fit and <mark>healthy young man like Hicks</mark>; you might start showing symptoms and quickly die before anyone even knows what's going on.

<mark>Then, there's the population of "Fury" 161, an almost completely abandoned prison planet.

So, they show up dressed in hazmat suits -- which is what some doctors chose to wear when they treated AIDS patients.

*"You're all gonna die. The only question is how you check out. Do you wanna go on your feet or on your fucking knees, begging? I ain't much for begging! Nobody ever gave me nothing. So, I say, fuck that thing. Let's fight it."*

It's badass, and <mark>strikes the exact same tone as Larry Kramer's speech from when he launched ACT UP in New York in 1987</mark>, five years before Alien 3 was released: "If my speech tonight doesn't scare the shit out of you, we're in real trouble.

**Contagion, Queer Intimacies, and the Normative Couple.** <mark>At first glance, *It Follows* would seem an unlikely candidate for a queer reading, since it features neither protagonists nor monsters that might be coded as “queer”</mark> in an identity-based sense. Following Harry Benshoff’s influential 1997 study *Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film*, most academic discussions of queer horror cinema have tended to explore how the genre’s depictions of monstrosity can be read as symbolizing the supposed “threat” of homosexuality, offering both pleasures and misgivings among gay and lesbian viewers.<sup>3</sup> <mark>Nor does *It Follows* register any of the overtly homoerotic appeal exhibited in</mark>, say, David DeCoteau’s<sup>†</sup> beefcake horror films that represent “part of the ongoing hegemonic negotiation of exactly what the phrase ‘queer horror film’ might actually signify.”<sup>4</sup> For understandable reasons of political reclamation,established minoritarian identities like “gay” and “lesbian” remain the dominant points of reference in much of this critical literature. Although the previously cited authors do highlight how queerness can operate in these films in multivalent ways for different audiences, “queer” ultimately tends to operate in these accounts as more of an umbrella term for a variety of same-sex-desiring identities rather than to suggest a fluidity of (nonnormative) desires that would evade or blur the very boundaries of minoritarian identities—or, as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick puts it in her famous definition:“[T]he open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone’s gender, of anyone’s sexuality aren’t made (or *can’t be* made) to signify <mark>monolithically</mark>.”<sup>5</sup>

But anyone who mentioned that they were using the drug, commonly known as <mark>PrEP, immediately found themselves being slut-shamed</mark>. Many doctors could be judgmental of patients asking for the once-a-day pill, thrusting their moral opinions on a medical issue. And so, for some time, many people in the gay community refused to ask their doctors for a prescription. Shaming people for wanting to add an extra layer of safety to their sex life. PrEP is much more common now, resulting in transmission rates of the HIV virus dropping dramatically. 

But, for a time, right around the release of *It Follows* the shame of being seen as promiscuous by doctors or friends stopped a lot of people from getting the new little blue pill. Until then anything but monogamy, even with a condom, was looked at as a risky, dangerous, and irresponsible behavior in much of the queer community.

That's something that horror expert Wes Craven did all too well. By making the violent killer of a film someone you would have usually sympathized with in *The Last House on the Left*. Perverting the relative safety of dreams with *A Nightmare on Elm Street*. Blurring the lines between horror and real life with *His New Nightmare*. And then bringing horror to the safest of all places in Clinton America, the suburbs, with *Scream*.

Written by out-gay screenwriter Kevin Williamson, *Scream* tells the tale of Sydney Prescott, who a year after her mother's murder is having those old wombs figuratively and literally reopened. But the queerness of the film has nothing to do with Sydney or her mother, but with the killers, Billy and Stu, as well as the uncomfortable social changes toward a more LGBT-accepting society in the late 1990s.

(<mark>Both were sentenced to life imprisonment; one of the men was shortly thereafter murdered by another inmate.</mark>) <mark>This case has generated several fictional treatments</mark>, ranging from <mark>Hitchcock's significant 1948 film *Rope*</mark>, based on the 1929 British stage play by Patrick Hamilton (which was retitled *Rope's End* for its New York premiere) to the 1959 novel *Compulsion*, directed by Richard Fleischer (based on the 1956 novel by Meyer Levin), to the 1992 *Swoon*, an independent film written and directed by Tom Kalin that has come to represent the New Queer Cinema of the era. Adding to the mystique of this paradigm is the real-life case that was famously turned into the 1966 "nonfiction novel" *In Cold Blood* by Truman Capote: the 1959 killing of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, by two young men. (Richard Brooks made a 1967 film of Capote's book.) Capote's tormented, erotically charged bond with one of the killers has been widely reported.

[...] desire for the mother into exogamous desire for a woman who resembles her but is outside of the family.

But what of the so-called *<mark>negative Oedipus complex</mark>*, in which things go awry? <mark>Homosexuality is the chief among these.</mark> <mark>In a footnote added in 1910 to his 1905 *Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality*, Freud conjectures that homosexual identity emerges from an identification with the mother.</mark> After the phase in their childhood in which they intensely identify with the mother rather than the father, homosexuals "identify themselves with a woman and take themselves as their sexual object. That is to say, they proceed from a narcissistic basis, and look for a young man who resembles themselves and whom they may love as their mother loved them."

For our purposes, what is especially interesting is the central ity of woman to Freud's theory of male homosexual narcissism. Her role and her love and, most importantly, her desire become the models for the homosexual male's own version of all of these, as we have noted.

<mark>While many have read Freud's theory as homophobic,</mark> in my view it is <mark>fairer to say that it has been put to homophobic uses in American psychiatry, which historically used it to pathologize homosexuality as arrested development</mark> rather than suggesting that homophobic in and of itself. Freud is describing the psychological experience of a male who identifies with mother rather than father, and while it would be naive to say such an identification is true for all homosexual men, it certainly is true for some.

What films like <mark>*Scream* make vividly clear is the cultural reception of narcissistic, mother-identified desire.

A queer reading becomes more obvious at, least to me, when the pair of killers decide they need to stab each other in order to frame Sydney for the killings, penetrating one another to show their devotion, replicating the pain of virginal anal sex. 

*Scream* with its queer coding, delicious dialogue, and willingness to reach into camp territory when necessary, has become a classic slasher among the queer community. While we watch it as a smart send up of the genre, which was well and dead in 1996, many people of the more hetero persuasion see the film a bit differently. Ut's the horror of danger coming to the suburbs, a place of safety being perverted, where nice white families fled to in order to escape the poor, black, and queer horrors that filled the city streets.

And in *Scream*, the queer horror penetrated that safety. It also tore apart the idea of the ideal American family.

Both encounters registers historically strained relations between institutional authorities and women under threat</mark>, wherein women victims find themselves the focus of censure. Even the homely, familiar detail of the internal window that links Amelia and Samuel’s house to Mrs Roach’s—so typical of the Sydney terrace—works both as a link to a quasi-maternal support for the at-risk pair but also offers yet another potential site of observation. Mrs Roach (Barbara West) is both a lifeline and inspiration, but also, like her namesake, a source of irritation for Amelia once she begins her monstrous transformation.

The Babadook's queerness lies in its subversion of the family, in its apparent danger to what is accepted by society, by only growing in power the more it is denied. Like a gaping wound that begins to fester each time a person lies about their sexuality. Every time someone pretends to be someone they're not so that society will accept them. 

And there's an odd draw to the black and white monster for queer people. Outside the movie, it was looked at as a joke, like so many queer icons initially are. Cher, Judy Garland, Dolly Parton, all looked at as over-the-top and worth nothing more than derision. And then they enter into a cultural permanence once they're adopted by the queer community.

> ### Richie uses humor to hide and distance himself from trauma but also bisexuality

Although, of particular note:

> It makes sense that Richie would be hyperaware of how he is perceived, particularly since Derry has a violent, homophobic history. This explains why Richie always covers his passes at Eddie as jokes. He doesn’t only jokingly flirt with Eddie, though. He does the same thing in this next scene with Beverly. Richie must constantly put up a comedic front so he can explore his bisexuality without being taken seriously.

<mark>Throughout It: Chapter Two, it becomes clear that Richie is a closeted gay man in love with</mark> his childhood best friend, <mark>Eddie</mark> (James Ransone plays the adult version). <mark>Mostly this revelation becomes clear through two scenes.</mark> <mark>The first is a flashback of Richie hanging out at an arcade the same summer the Losers defeated Pennywise</mark> the first time. <mark>He plays Street Fighter with a kid</mark> we’ve never seen before. <mark>When the kid says he has to go, Richie offers to pay for the next round</mark> of games. <mark>Unfortunately, the new kid’s cousin, Henry Bowers, lives to torment Richie and his friends. Now face to face with a stab-happy bully, and surrounded by the judging eyes of his peers, Richie’s sexual orientation, and therefore masculinity, is challenged by his crush.</mark>

<mark>Richie runs out of the arcade and seeks refuge in a public park. Before him stands the symbol of masculinity: a giant ax swinging Paul Bunyan looming 20 feet</mark> high. <mark>In his flannel and denim, he's a stark contrast to Richie's blue and pink swirled button-up shirt. The American folk hero instantly becomes a threat with shredded teeth</mark>.

<mark>Richie runs out of the arcade and seeks refuge in a public park. Before him stands the symbol of masculinity; a giant, ax-swinging Paul Bunyan looms 20 feet</mark> over a young Richie. <mark>In his flannel and denim, he’s a stark contrast to Richie’s blue and pink swirled button-up shirt. The American folk hero instantly becomes a threat with shredded teeth</mark> like a whale, but sharp like a shark’s tooth. While the giant tries to stab Richie, a crowd stands by and watches it happen. The fear, bullying and ultimately the way in which adults ignore bullying are accurate to the 1989 time period.

<mark>The second scene that reveals Richie is queer</mark> doesn't happen until <mark>Eddie dies. Everyone is sad, but Richie is beside himself, so overcome with emotion that he has to be hauled out of the sewer by his friends. Adult Richie doesn't seem to fit into a 2019 narrative. Not everyone can come out in America</mark>, <mark>but Richie works as a comedian in Los Angeles; even if he chose to keep his sexuality close to the vest, the idea that</mark> gay marriage and giant pride parades <mark>could miss a white man working in Hollywood doesn't make sense. If it did, highlighting that fact would be vital to understanding the character.</mark>

<mark>The second scene that reveals Richie as queer</mark> happens when <mark>Eddie dies. Everyone is sad, but Richie is beside himself, so overcome with emotions he has to be hauled out of the sewer by his friends. Adult Richie doesn’t seem to fit into a 2019 narrative. Not everyone can come out in America</mark>. There are many different reasons for remaining in the proverbial closet. Some careers, like a being a professional athlete or conservative analyst, can be difficult for an openly gay man to maintain. <mark>But Richie works as a comedian in Los Angeles. Even if he chose to keep his sexual orientation close to the vest, the idea that</mark> the ’00s marriage legalization or the ’90s coming out celebration <mark>could miss a white man working in Hollywood doesn’t make sense.

<mark>The murky nature of Richie's queer identity feels like a letdown.</mark> 

<mark>The second chapter of *It* attempts to reveal the way dormant childhood trauma springs forth in adulthood. Anything buried will eventually rise to the surface.</mark> Except for Richie's sexuality, apparently. 

<mark>The queer community</mark> is <mark>still struggling to be seen in cinema as more than tragic</mark> romances or gay best friends. <mark>The balance of the identity representation within the Losers Club offered an awesome opportunity to detail the effects of the past 30 years on the most privileged members of the community.</mark> But, in the film, <mark>Richie</mark>, a well-off white masculine gay man, <mark>never even says that he's gay out loud.</mark>

Screenwriter Gary Dauberman and Hader have both shared their thoughts about the depiction.

Anything buried will eventually rise to the surface.</mark> There has never been a more traumatic time for <mark>the queer community</mark> than the AIDs epidemic.

Not everything in *It* is coding though. Very <mark>early</mark> on in the story we are shown the brutal <mark>gay-bashing and violent murder of Adrian Mellon</mark>, a murder so heinous it wakes the titular It from its decades-long slumber. King's language is harsh, with characters using a vast array of <mark>homophobic</mark> <mark>slurs</mark> in those early pages, but those characters using them, even the police <mark>are not celebrated</mark>. <mark>The author is very clearly judging them.</mark> And it's this horrible violence so soon into the book that shows the darkness and hate lurking under the surface of Small Town America.

It is <mark>the hate that's unnatural. The hate that is evil.</mark> Not being queer. <mark>When we get into the head of Don Hagerty, Adrian's boyfriend, and the author lets the reader know him</mark>, <mark>he's sympathetic, he's smart, and loving. He also sees the town for what it is. Sees its evil clearly and wants to leave it.</mark> Though the characters in the book don't empathize with him for having his boyfriend killed in front of him, the author does. He shows the gay character as human.

An <mark>early</mark> section of the novel describes a <mark>gay bashing and the violent murder of Adrian Mellon</mark>, a gay man, with all the <mark>homophobic</mark> language my 13-year-old vocabulary contained. It even taught me a few brand new <mark>slurs</mark> against myself. Whether I feared being beaten and thrown over a bridge before reading the book or whether it birthed that specific fear in me, I can’t say, but I read that section breathless, because there it was, in black and white on the page of this 1200-page book: that the adults around me said and thought the things I feared they said and thought. I wasn’t crazy. My fears were valid, or else why would a horror writer write them? I felt seen. Scared, but seen.

Middle-schoolers aren’t taken very seriously by our culture. [...] King takes young people seriously.

There was more to the representation of hate crime in IT for me, though. The opening section is, undoubtedly, filled with problematic stereotypes and hateful language, but when the bullies and the cops toss their anti-gay slurs around, they <mark>are not celebrated</mark> for it. <mark>The author is very clearly judging them.</mark> The gay-bashing is the first evidence the reader gets that evil is returning to the town of Derry; that something terribly unnatural is afoot, and it’s not homosexuality. <mark>The hate is unnatural, the hate is evil.</mark> <mark>When we get into the head of Don Hagarty, Adrian’s boyfriend, and the author lets the reader know him</mark> in his own thoughts—the first time I’d ever known a gay person outside of the news—<mark>he’s sympathetic. He’s smart and loving. He also sees the town for what it is, sees its evil clearly and wants to leave it.</mark>

In the midst of Reagan America, the world's best-selling author was sending a very blunt message. <mark>Stephen King thought gay people should be able to date, and hold hands, and live their lives. Stephen King did not think gay people should be tortured or killed. He thought that those who would torture or kill gay people were in the service of evil. As were those who would tolerate it or look away. The victims of homophobia did not deserve to be victims.</mark> 

<mark>Homophobia, Stephen King seemed to say, is not the natural way of the world. It is a monstrous thing. And those who practice it are a part of the monster.</mark> Like *The Babadook*, *Hellraiser*, *Jennifer's Body*, *The Craft*, and King's own *Carrie*, the queer is not the monster. Something else is. Gay men, lesbian women, bisexual people, transgender people... everyone under the queer umbrella. We are not the monsters. You are not the monster. But the society that demonizes you... that others you... That is the monster.
