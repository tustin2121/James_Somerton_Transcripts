Over the last several years there have been demands for more LGBTQ represention in Hollywood movies. But something that many people don’t know is that the first movie to ever win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, was also <mark x num=1>the first major Hollywood film to show a gay kiss</mark>. 

<mark num=2>William A. Wellman</mark>’s film *Wings*. Released <mark num=3>in 1927</mark>. In "Wings," <mark>two World War I aviators</mark> <mark>compete for the affections of the same woman while coming to terms with their growing feelings for one another. Despite being labeled a "friendship" for the duration of the film</mark> (perhaps to circumvent censorship requirements), <mark>it is evident that these two men are developing romantic feelings for one another</mark>. Made clear by the climactic <mark>dramatic kiss</mark>. 

<mark x>Wellman's silent film captures one of the earliest examples of LGBTQ</mark> cinema <mark x>by carefully toeing the censorship line</mark>; the film examines the expressed passions of two men entangled in the conflict of WWI and the emotional torment of a forbidden connection. 

<mark x>*Wings* went on to be a box office smash</mark>, and even at a time when the film industry was quickly transitioning to sound, became the only truly silent film <mark x>to win Best Picture</mark>.

Prior to the Production Code, LGBT characters were somewhat prevalent, if heavily stereotyped and exploited, in a number of major films. The 1920s especially were a time of shifting societal norms and expanding artistic experimentation. As women rode the first wave of feminism and prohibition was increasingly challenged, filmmakers began to expand their boundaries and feature more controversial plotlines. This set the stage for *Wings* which was directed by <mark num=2>William A. Wellman</mark> <mark num=3>in 1927</mark> and featured what is considered <mark x num=1>the first gay kiss in an American film</mark>.

Wings follows <mark>two Air Force pilots in World War I,</mark> Jack and Dave, who <mark>compete for the affections of a beautiful girl before discovering the true love they feel for each other. While the relationship is referred to repeatedly as a friendship</mark>, the acting and directing of the film make <mark>it obvious that the men’s feelings were romantic</mark>. The storyline ends when one of the men is fatally injured. He dies in his lover’s arms after a <mark>passionate kiss</mark>. Despite the condemnation of gay men in society as a whole at this time period, the film is surprisingly respectful of love between the two characters (Denesi). The camera remains mostly still in a tight shot of Jack and Dave embracing as they share a final goodbye. Jack assures Dave as he nears death that nothing meant more to him than their relationship. A swell of romantic string instruments play in the background as Jack mourns over Dave’s still body. The directing choices made by Wellman humanized both characters and allowed the audience to experience the tragedy without exploiting the perceived exoticness of a relationship between two men. <mark x>This film is exemplary of many films featuring gay characters in the 1920s</mark>. Wellman escaped criticism over his inclusion of gay characters <mark x>by very carefully walking the line</mark> between friends and lovers. To anyone not paying close attention, Jack and Dave could easily pass as close friends. <mark x>The movie was incredibly well-received</mark> and was <mark x>chosen as Best Picture for the 1927–1928 cycle</mark>. However, not all films featuring LGBT characters handled the issue as sensitively as *Wings*. One of the earliest kisses featuring two women was featured in Morocco, a 1930 film directed by Josef Von Sternberg.

But *Wings* is actually not where our story begins. The history of Hollywood has always had an asterisk beside it. Hidden in the footnotes in tiny little print, are the queer actors, filmmakers, executives, and tradespeople that helped turn Hollywood from a backwater orange grove in California to the city in which thousands of young dreamers make their way each year in hopes of becoming a star. It’s a long story. And like most classic American tales… it actually doesn’t begin in America at all.

These stupid titles are impossible to read because the font is so thin, spaced out, miniscule, and white over yellow most of the time. If I had to suffer, so should you, muahahaha.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Box_(1929_film)#Rediscovery_and_restoration) states that the movie was "rediscovered" in the 1950s. [A much more in-depth source](http://filmint.nu/louise-brooks-and-the-exhibition-history-of-pandoras-box-1929-thomas-gladysz/) says that it started in wider circulation in the 1962 after decades of occasional showings.

<mark>One of the earliest direct references to male homosexuality</mark> in an American film came, <mark>predictably</mark>, in a comedy spoof. <mark num=4>Stan Laurel</mark>'s <mark num=3>one-reel comedy short *The Soilers*</mark> (1923) was a <mark>takeoff on Rex Beach's popular 1914 western *The Spoilers*.</mark> Set in Alaska during the gold rush, the film offers Stan Laurel as Bob Cannister, a patsy who strikes it rich only to be fleeced by an unscrupulous local sheriff. Most of the action consists of<mark> a drawn out fight scene between Laurel and the sheriff</mark>, who brawl the entire length of an old-time saloon During the fight, an ordinary-looking cowboy flounces gaily onto the set, hand on hip. He <mark>bats his eyes at both men</mark>, fluffs his hair before a mirror and <mark>primps a bit before sashaying out of the room</mark> as the two men continue to fight. <mark>Laurel beats the villain, but nobody seems to care</mark>, and he ends up <mark>sitting dejectedly outside the saloon</mark>, his face buried in his hands. <mark>The gay cowboy pokes his head out of a second floor window and extravagantly blows Laurel a kiss, mouthing the words "My Hero"</mark> (reinforced by a flowered title card). <mark>When Laurel spums him</mark> with a disgusted wave of his hand, the miffed cowboy <mark>drops a potted petunia on his head</mark>.

Early efforts of the film colony to regulate itself proved clearly inadequate to moral and religious leaders. To complicate matters, there were inconsistencies as a result of local interpretations of the laws.

In his book *See No Evil*, censor Jack Vizzard recalls an informal chat with Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn at which several other Hays Office representatives were present. Cohn was describing how he had planned to have his current big star, Grace Moore, sing "La Marseillaise" at the fall of the Bastille in her new film, and censor Geoffrey Shurlock interrupted with, "You can't do it, Harry. The Marseillaise wasn't written until three years after the fall of the Bastille."

"Who cares?" Cohn shouted. "Who would know a thing like that but a queer like you, anyway?"

Onscreen this kind of hostility was stated hardly more delicately, but since homosexuality did not officially exist, the thrust of such basically homophobic sentiment was directed elsewhere. Symbols of masculinity were defended by the use of sumbols for homosexuality. <mark>The fact that most early movie sissies were homosexual only if one chose to see them as being homosexual was simply a reflection of the fact that the existence of homosexuals in society was acknowledged only when society chose to do so.</mark> Although the presence of sissies in the Thirties and Forties did not imply that homosexuality in fact existed, it implied that homosexuals could exist if things were topsy-turvy, and it provided a subtextual reminder that the basic illusion of America was pretty shabby.

<mark>Although the character of Joel Cairo</mark> (Peter Lorre) <mark>in *The Maltese Falcon*</mark> (1941) <mark>is identified by Sam Spade's secretary in</mark> Dashiell Hammett's novel <mark>as a homosexual</mark>, <mark>the film version</mark> <mark>just turns him into a perfumed</mark> fop <mark>with lace hankies</mark>. A brief, sarcastic reference by a venomous Mary Astor to "that young boy in Istanbul," the character with whom Cairo had a little trouble, is murky and unexplored. <mark>Elisha Cook, Jr., as Sidney Greenstreet's bodyguard Wilmer, however, is implicitly homosexual. He is referred to as "sonny." "boy" and "kid," and Bogart derisively calls him a "gunsel."</mark> <mark>Since about 1915,</mark> bums and <mark>prisoners had used the German word</mark> *gansel* or *gosling*, corrupted to <mark>*gunsel*, for a passive sodomite, especially a young, inexperienced</mark> boy compan&shy;ion. From the mid 1920s it gradually came to mean a sneaky or disreputable person of any kind. By the 1930s it meant petty gangster or hoodlum. That film characters like Wilmer and the taxi driver in *Blood Money* shared a feminine status is obvious. The only variation was the degree to which that equation was carried to its common underworld conclusion.

*Rocky Horror* was shining a spotlight on the *dimly* lit representation of queer monsters in the 1930s golden age of Hollywood. Giving them one last hurrah as a posthumous victory against the Hayes code, which collapsed *entirely* just a few years before its release. 

But back in the 1930s, filmmakers still had to be clever about coding the characters, specifically to make it past the censors. 

General American audiences though could easily see through the coding. However, it wasn’t long before the easily read coding... was forced to become almost, if not completely illegible.
