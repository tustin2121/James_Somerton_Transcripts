This video is brought to you by SquareSpace. Cabaret is a film that serves as a
stark reminder

of how quietly a society can fall into fascism, especially when those with
privilege are willing

to turn a blind eye to atrocities taking place. Set in 1930s Berlin, the movie
explores the

rise of the Naxi party and its impact on the lives of ordinary people,
particularly those

in the entertainment industry. The story follows the lives of a writer named

Brian and a cabaret performer named Sally Bowles, who both become caught up in
the political

turmoil of the time. One of the key themes of Cabaret is the danger

of complacency in the face of fascism. The film portrays a society in which the
majority

of people are either indifferent or actively supportive of the Naxi party. This
isn’t really shoved in the audience’s

face though, since the real plot revolves around a bisexual love triangle. It
has Surprise Naxis, like The Sound of Music. This willingness to ignore the
third reich

is especially evident though in the character of Max, a wealthy German Baron who
is happy

to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Naxi regime, even as he
turns a blind

eye to the horrors being committed by the party. Max's character serves as a
reminder that

those with privilege often have the luxury of ignoring the suffering of others,
as long

as it does not directly affect them. The character of Sally Bowles also
highlights

the dangers of complacency and privilege in the face of fascism. Sally is a
talented performer who enjoys the

freedoms and opportunities that come with life in Berlin's bohemian community.
However, she is also naive and self-centered,

with little interest in politics or the world outside her own narrow sphere. As
the Naxis begin to tighten their grip on

power, Sally remains oblivious to the danger, choosing instead to focus on her
own personal

ambitions. It is only when she is directly confronted

with the realities of fascism that she begins to understand the gravity of the
situation,

and instead chooses to turn a blind eye… Another key theme of Cabaret is the
role of

propaganda in the rise of fascism. The film shows how the Naxi party used
performing

arts, specifically singing, to promote its message and win over ordinary people.
This is most evident in the character of the

Emcee, the flamboyant and charismatic host of the Kit Kat Klub. While the Emcee
initially seems like a harmless

figure, he gradually becomes more and more sinister as the story progresses,
using his

position to spread Naxi propaganda and sow the seeds of hatred and intolerance.
Overall, Cabaret serves as a powerful warning

about the dangers of fascism and the ease with which a society can fall into it,
especially

when those with privilege are willing to turn a blind eye to the suffering of
others. And one group that is historically brilliant

at pretending bad things aren’t happening, or only happen to them, is straight
people. But before we proceed to tonight’s entertainment,

today with Squarespace The thing is. We grew up hearing ‘Naxis are bad.’ This
wasn’t really a shock to any of us. In fact, late night cartoons and even spoof

movies made a punchline out of somehow making the villain of the story some
random group

of Naxis. And Indiana Jones. It was a for-granted indication that no matter

what violence this group of villains endured, parents groups would consider it
‘safe.’ Because they were Naxis. We knew what the Naxis stood for and stood

against. That truth and justice heroically stood against

Naxi bigotry and intolerance — again, something easily made into a punchile.
Fruity Hixler also wasn’t out of the cultural

awareness either. So given that the culture was aware of what

made the Naxis bad, how are we watching a certain group of people slip into that
cultural

mindset of fascistic intolerance all over again? How is it so easy for certain
groups of people

to blame immigrants, ethnic or religious minorities, queer people, or even women
for all the problems

in the world — instead of holding their leadership and government institutions
accountable? It’s not even enough to say ‘this keeps

happening’ and, instead, more accurate to say: this won’t stop happening. Why is
it so easy for straight, white, cisgener,

(usually) men to slip into this kind of militant bigotry like we see in Cabaret,
and like we

see beginning to play out today. And in spite of a large chorus of our society

claiming that we don’t have anything to worry about, nearly everyone who lived
through

things like the events in Cabaret are pointing out the red flags. It’s hard to
plot out the dance steps to

the organized, violent xenophobia — often because it’s not usually deliberate.
It’s a reaction to present events that take

different forms. Sometimes there’s financial hardship, other

times not. Sometimes there’s a new ethnic group entering

the state, other times the ethnic group is well established. Sometimes there’s a
political counter-movement,

other times not. Two things seem to be constant in this pattern. The first is
that there is a perceived threat

to the hegemonistic way of life. The second, is that figureheads arise who

point out that things were better before and that they’re worse now because of a
specific

reason. That reason is… almost always a group of

people that they don’t like. A later stage of this process involves the

leadership of this group insisting that to make things go back to what they
were, they

just need to… get rid of the thing that’s different. Or rather… the thing they
perceive as being different. There’s a lot of writing about fascist regimes,

how to spot them developing, or spotting patterns in their ideological belief
systems. But what it boils down to… seems to be a

matter of what they perceive, and how they chose to trust their perception over
all else. And the easiest way to explain this is with

cake. If you don’t have any cake, are you going

to get upset that you don’t have any other cake? Generally not, no. You may get
some cravings now and then, but

these are spontaneous. Usually, you have to be reminded that cake

exists to really want it. In which case, getting a spontaneous reminder

about cake — when you have a medical condition that makes your body allergic to
carbohydrates

— kinda sucks. But cake was never an expectation in the first

place so it blows over. However, if someone promises you cake as a

reward for, say, a series of rigorous and perhaps deadly scientific experiments…
you’re going to get really excited about

the cake! And even though you did not have the cake

before, if the cake was a lie, you’re going to feel like the cake was taken away
from

you. Now the tricky part about this class of baby

fascists is that, even though cake was never an option, they perceive a promise
of cake. Cake which they would have never received

and never will receive. So they are angry. And while anger can be a potent and
necessary

motivational tool, if you spend too long being angry — getting what you want
isn’t going

to make you feel better — you just want to have your anger justified. You want
permission to be angry. Now in this analogy, the cake is an applicable

symbol. It can be sex, status, money, opportunities,

rights, freedom — the ability to harass people without repercussions. Those are
things though; the underlying motivation

seems to be a need to be able to have influence over the world. For whatever
manifestation it may take — cake

is influence. And privilege is qualified by any kind of

social expectation that you will get it. So. As much as you may have felt that
you were

promised cake, but do not have any cake, you feel like there is an injustice.
However, if you see that others have cake,

you may begin to feel covetous. Hannibal Lecter: “He Covets.” You may be very
inclined to feel that these

people who have cake are a threat to your ability to have cake. A key component
of this anger is the fear

and outrage of a perceived victimhood, which offers a sense of righteousness
when taking

steps to righting a perceived wrong. And this is where the metaphor unravels and

we can actually start talking about the real thing. Because modern
manifestations of fascism organize

around a particular kind of propaganda. It begins with two perceptions: that
there

is not enough cake to go around, and that the reason you do not have cake is
because

someone else has yours. Both of these premises are false. First: there is always
enough cake to go around

— if there isn’t, it’s due to the actions of an elite class who hoard the cake.
And they think they’re safe hoarding it

because we’ve let them believe that they are immune to diabetes. Second: the
blame for ‘who has all the cake’

is deflected from who is actually causing the problem by scapegoating a group of
people

who have few methods of legal protection. It’s the language of privilege that
makes

it difficult to really understand why it seems so easy for fascism to recruit
from the privileged. Especially when, within their own propaganda,

there is a paradox about privilege itself. On one hand, privilege doesn’t exist.
They hold up a handful of examples — to

the Naxis, it was Jewish Bankers. In our culture, dissident, angry, white people

are directed towards people of color. How can ‘white privilege’ exist when
individual

white people have it worse off than Oprah? They cite various scholarships
programs, or

laws designed to afford opportunities to women and people of color. And they
hold up these instances and say:

“there’s no assistance for straight white men, therefore these ‘supposed
minorities’

have privileges we do not have.” To them? Case CLOSED on racism, sexism, or
homophobia. Nevermind that these opportunities are in

place to offset a society which still to this day favors straight white
cisgender men. However, on the other side of this paradox

is the insistence that having privilege SHOULD afford those who have it with a
greater amount

of the influence that they seek. What’s the point of having privilege if

you don’t have opportunities to use it? The language of entitlement and
expectations

are used to establish a sense of what life should be like for this group of
people. This often calls back to periods of time in

national history where this demographic of people enjoyed a great amount of
cultural

influence. Privilege doesnot exist when they need to

describe the normative condition of how their lives OUGHT to look. Privilege
does NOT exist when they need to

frame their social victimization to justify the fervor around their outrage for
not having

the cake that their non-privilege should afford them. This is dumb. Like. It’s
so incredibly dumb that you wonder

how people who engage in this discussion can’t point it out. How can xenophobic,
exclusionary movements

of totalitarian control over a population resulting in genocide and ethnic
cleansing

that have shaped human history be rooted in this kind of errant, egregious
dumbness? Well, to quote Voltaire… “anything too stupid to be said… is sung.”
(“Tomorrow Belongs To Me”) A regularly-documented aspect of fascism is

the degree to which pageantry is used to… normalize it. And Make a spectacle of
it. Somehow it accomplishes both of these things. Spectacle makes it seem fun
and inviting,

while at the same time a regular performance of fascistic showmanship makes it
seem like

something that is socially acceptable to participate in. The “well, if
everyone’s doing it” mentality. There’s a much more sinister side to this

than just offering up some comedic levity. In queer circles, we speak to the
importance

of using representation in media to normalize queer identities. Not everyone is
going to grow up knowing the

many different kinds of queer people out there. By having these characters and
their experiences

represented in media, it can establish a sense of familiarity. However, the use
of pageantry can be used

against minority groups. While the initial spark of injustice seems

to be required to rally these groups together — economic problems or what have
you — these

actual causes begin to matter ‘less’ than having open permission to be hateful
and bigoted

without social recourse. In early-stages of rallying around hate, certain

rhetoric is passed around within the hate group. When it was still in the beer
halls, early

Naxis targeted Jewish Bankers, and held them up as an instance of the kind of
greed that

was keeping “pure Germans” from their full potential. (Whatever that means —
because Hixler was

actually Austrian…) And sure, there were probably some bankers

who were Jewish that were making life rough. But there were also a lot of
non-Jewish bankers;

and maybe the shitty shared quality was the ‘banker’ part, and not the Jewish
part. Some things never change. However the rhetoric circulating in these

hate groups said that because Jewish bankers were bad, that all Jewish people
must have

been bad. Enough time spent marinating in this echo

chamber, the less these qualities actually applied to Jews of a particular
profession,

and the more it was accepted — among the early Naxis and their supporters — that

these are just self-evident truths, for which no explanation or justification
was required. The initial rationality behind the hatred

was removed; ongoing persecution required no justification, and became a matter
of begging

the question. They deserve persecution so they must be bad;

they are bad because we know they are; they deserve persecution because they are
bad. The transition from ‘spreading awareness’

about a class of perceived “undesirables” begins with this abandonment of
reason. They literally abandon reasons for why they

should persecute this class. The hallmark here is the comfort with which

they begin to justify the ridicule of this group. Raising an alarm against some
kind of threat

to privilege, children, or the moral fiber of society — these are good for
calling

people to action. There is a threat, some righteous cause to

fight for. But that’s not enough: you have to make

the people comfortable with hatred. Hatred can’t feel like hatred or people

may reject it. Hatred has to feel ‘normal’ to be publicly

and personally acceptable… which is where comedy comes in. Good evening, Achmed.
Good evening. (Laughter) Comedy is an incredibly complex human interaction. It’s
often considered a cheap thrill by

theatrical standards, we consider it an easy form of entertainment when it comes
to fart

jokes or slapstick. However, comedies that engage audiences on

an intellectual level — such as TV shows like Veep or Arrested Development — are

often looped in with those base-level entertainments on merits alone. Whether or
not it’s easy to make someone

laugh (and for the fact that some people make it look a lot easier than it is),
that should

not dismiss the complex neurological process of comedy. As much as we may
dismiss comedy as lesser-than

media, there is no specific part of the brain that is specifically responsible
for laughter. This results in a range of neurological, psychological,

and philosophical debate about why we laugh. However, especially when
philosophers are

concerned, they all seem to hold a common element of linking laughter to both
danger,

and social connections, even if they disagree on how these elements result in
laughing. Suffice to say, laughter seems to be seen

as the result of a pleasant reaction or resolution of tension. That’s why we
laugh after jump scares in

horror movies. A joke is seen as a kind of psychological

maze for which the punchline is an escape: the relief to the tension of
anticipation

results in laughter. This is compounded in social situations where

we crave connection to other people more than we crave a satisfying outcome to
the maze. Definitely explains why you may watch some

comedians, and from the comfort of your couch they seem to be bombing, though
the crowd

seems to be laughing themselves to death. Also why they add a laugh track to
sitcoms

even when nothing is funny. The joint connection itself is a relief, and

a formative element of a positive memory. This element of social connection can
be very

beguiling, as often documented by film critics. At movie premieres, it’s more
than just

screening the movie. There’s food, drinks, entertainment, mingling

— these things foster a good memory before the movie even starts. Many people at
movie premieres will remark

that the screening itself was fantastic — only to later watch the movie without
the rose-tinted

glasses and realize that it wasn’t very good actually. I’m sure it isn’t hard to
see how this

applies to the spread of bigoted propaganda. And this is one of the most
concerning turning

points in Cabaret. The host sings a loving ballad about his beloved,

regarding the discrimination this gorilla faces, and how he doesn’t care at all
about

how she looks or her feral habits. This number is cute and light, and very
earnest

— and the audience naturally laughs because it’s so absurd. The film’s audience,
in contrast to the

cabaret’s audience in the early 30s who don’t know what’s around the corner for

Germany, is tricked into being tickled by this warm comedic number. The shock
comes with the final line of the

number… MC: “She wouldn’t look Jewish at all.” Big ooof indeed. To the
in-universe audience, this is just

a joke. And people who are offended at the establishment

using its platform and production to play into existing stereotypes “just need
to

learn to take a joke.” The combination of being lulled into a sense

of groupthink through joint participation in a joke, regardless of quality, in
conjunction

with the familiarizing act of a joke’s role in presenting a sense of relief and
comfort

— it’s no surprise that this is yet another tactic in fascistic pipelines. Hook
people in with the threat, familiarize

them with comedic theatrics, and install a sense of pride through pageantry. The
Naxis specifically came at the public

through a two-pronged approach. Although he was nothing but a lowly paper

hanger, Hixler had a knack for spotting world-class talent and giving them an
unbridled platform,

changing the course of art history. But on the other hand, for the working
class,

his cabinet empowered ‘base’ entertainers — comedians, thespians, singers, and,
yes,

the proprietors of clubs and cabarets. Which… is another unfortunate parallel we

see expanding before our very eyes today. It really shouldn’t come as a surprise
to

me that there are a slew of stand-up comedians who are explicitly going out of
their way

to target trans people. As a culture, we really ought to use it as

a litmus test about who, in the profession, actually goes out of their way to
make original

content. Going after minorities or small communities

is a low-hanging fruit. It doesn’t take a whole lot of talent to

point to something different and say: “Boy. You’ve heard about this thing. The
people who do this thing. It’s different, isn’t it?” [Laugh track] “Like
reaaaaaaaly different…” [Laugh track — light.] “Anyone… uh… anyone notice this?
It’s different right?” [Laugh track — audience agrees.] “It’s so different —
it’s completely

outside the accepted norm of established socio-political influence and
authority. [Laugh track] It’s like we live our normal lives, and

we don’t even THINK about this, but these people LIVE like this, right? They
ACTUALLY do the thing that we accept

as different without observing cultural or historic context!” [Laugh track —
heavy.] “And we’re just gonna assume OUR way of

doing things is the objectively correct way to do things. So we can just all
agree that it's different.” [Laugh track and clapping.] [Pause] “Racial and/or
ethnic slur.” [Thunderous applause.] “RIGHT???” Though these days comedians
don’t even bother

discussing anti-trans hate in their stand-up. It’s pretty much just a bigoted
tirade that

the audience howls at because the culture has conditioned them to believe that
being

told not to hate people is synonymous with oppression. Meanwhile, the stand up
comedians playing

into this static, snapshot of culture are the same ones claiming that the public
holding

them accountable for saying hateful things is an infringement on their freedom.
Which says a whole lot more than I think they

mean to because if you have freedom, and you use it to choose hatred, you need
to consider

that hatred isn’t exactly the gateway drug for more freedom. Many stand up
comedians like to talk themselves

up as having this philosophically esoteric role to the culture as being the
first and

last line of defense for freedom of speech. Ignoring the flood of reporters and
now even

elected representatives who are censored and silenced. But… but… without
stand-up comedians,

society would never be able to push boundaries. The role of stand-up comedy is
to make people

uncomfortable when a society gets too comfortable with its own status quo… or
something along

those lines. And then they turn RIGHT around to complain

about why they can’t use comedy to target minorities anymore. You know. The
people who are pushed outside the fringes

of social acceptance. I think in a lot of ways stand-up comedians

are jealous of people who belong to these minority groups. (And I do hate using
the term minorities,

but bear with me.) They long to exist as these fringe rockstars

who push boundaries, meanwhile people outside the straight, cis, white hegemony
do that

just by existing. The Penguin: You’re just jealous because

I’m a genuine freak — and you have to wear a mask! Batman: You might be right.
No, that isn’t the last time I’m going

to use that clip. Not to disrespect stand-up as an art. Lewis Black, Kathy
Griffin, the late great

Robin Williams, and George Carlin. And now Hannah Gadsby. Funny as hell, and
they don’t attack people

in need of help. They punched up. The targets of their comedy were either
self-directed,

individuals or institutions who do have a large amount of influence, or social
trends

among the hegemony as a whole. Targeting trans people, or other minorities,

accomplishes a process of othering these people by highlighting their
differences as different

from the norm. The aforementioned comedians who I feel are

worthy of respect, instead, often target the INSTITUTIONS that propagate this
‘othering.’ On top of the great difficulty that it takes

to make these acts entertaining, there is a great deal of power that this kind
of charisma

holds. Crowds of people may be easily swayed by a

charismatic figure. And such a figure who seems so comfortable

with their subject material that it can be passed to a crowd as common sense.
Through framing and context, the masses agree

that because this person on a stage is making a joke out of it, that it must be
true. And if one thing they say is true, everything

they say must come from that self-evident context. What is said doesn’t need to
be true — but

if it is spoken with enough confidence, people will believe that its true. And
the primary component of telling a joke

is that it’s only funny if you say it with confidence. Marlin:

there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea... Well, he doesn't walk up, he
swims up. Well, actually, the mollusk isn't moving,

he's in one place. And then the sea cucumber- A famous quote by Bertrand Russell
— and

I apologize if he’s problematic, he’s been dead for fifty years. But the quote,
which remains exceptionally

poingnet, goes: “The whole problem with the world is fools

and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people are so full
of doubts.” This harmonizes with Socrates' famous line: “The only thing I know
is that I know nothing.” Or Albert Einstein’s: “Common sense is

nothing more than a deposit of prejudices laid down in the mind before age
eighteen.” The more we learn, the more knowledge we realize

we do not possess. The more we may be informed that previously-held

beliefs are false, and the less we may trust new information. But this is the
tricky thing about doubt…

you have to know what to place it in, and how to do it. Doubt, like any other
intelligence, is a skill. How do you know what should be questioned

and what should be taken for granted? If you apply this skill wrongly, you may
offer

up sympathy for the devil. “Money Makes the World Go Around”

“The world go around. The world-” We’re entering a period of time where an

inordinate amount of narrative effort in fiction is driven by a need to
deconstruct someone’s

rationale for WHY they’re villains. I mean we really shouldn’t need a whole

lot of explanation to understand why that’s probably a problematic element of
society

today. In the instance of someone being a total dickwad,

an empathetic society would rather support the victim than focus on the
perpetrator in

question. Granted, our culture has this fixation on

victim blaming. As if someone is asking to get burgled if

they have their valuables in a jewelry box instead of a safety deposit box. Cut
to the: “well what was she wearing?” argument. Of course, empathizing with
victims in a pragmatic

way would result in making changes to core elements of society that generate
these crimes

or aggressions in the first place and we’re allergic to that. There’s a mindset
that, if we interview,

analyze, and reason with individuals within fascism — those who even 20 years
ago would

have been easily considered villains, yet saying that today somehow makes it
‘political’

— that if we get inside their head we can figure out what makes them tick. That
it’s important to understand WHY they’re

fascist. What elements of the culture are feeding into

this? Which… first… yeah we’ve been doing that but

at the same time I’m not seeing a whole lot of administrative directives aimed
at

redirecting people away from fascist pipelines. This is what people have been
screaming at

Facebook, Twitter, Tumbler, and even YouTube to do for ages. And failing that,
with business lords citing

freedom of… the market… or whatever — we looked to our democratic leaders to
oppose

an indoctrinating political system whose sole purpose is to usurp democracy and
we continually

get a big ol’ ‘meh.’ The ending result of this is an after-school

special about bullying. A lot of TV shows had one. The main characters are
getting horribly bullied,

and they get mad at their bully for bullying them, so they concoct some revenge
scheme,

and then they learn that their bully was actually bullied themselves, and then
they feel bad

and apologize for their revenge, and their bully is never held accountable for
being

an absolute dick! I’m not outing myself as a Broney. My co-writer had a stoner
phase and was held

at gunpoint to binge a lot of kids shows. This particular episode is shitty
because

it sets a precedent for ignoring wrongs against you, in lieu of empathizing with
the people

wronging you. This is formative children’s media… Why is it fostering a sense of
martyrdom? Sure friendship and cooperation are great,

but when it comes to this friendship-vibes-only, how much are you supposed to
endure before

you stand up for yourself? And this is compounded through a collection

of modern animated films. Dreamworks’ The Bad Guys itself was a movie

focusing exclusively on this. With the added twist of the surprise villain

(Which is now a staple of Disney too)… who you could spot the second he was on
screen. But still, the primary discussion of that

film was “Let’s talk about WHY the bad guys are bad.” Meanwhile: the only thing
I want to talk about

was why are only the main characters furries? Couldn’t they throw in an anthro
or two

in the background? While I thought it was a decent animated movie,

the conclusion the film comes to is that people are ‘bad’ because that’s how
they’re

treated their whole lives. Which may or may not be true, but the script

does outstandingly little to outline what ‘bad’ means, when I feel that there —
on

a societal level — needs to be a much more nuanced understanding of badness.
People committing petty crimes are ‘bad’

because they’re locked in a cycle of poverty and this is how they have been
conditioned

to think is an acceptable way to make ends meet. While the depiction of
carnivores in Bad Guys

establishes this on a visual level, there’s little done to explore this nuance,
or offer

any kind of resolution to the problem. In fact, by the end of the movie, there
is

no social prerogative for society to change its perspective on visual profiling.
The only social development is that the population

learns that you can’t trust furries. Any of them. The audience is meant to take
away the real

messaging of course, to not judge a book by its cover. Give the ‘bad guys’ a
chance. But it does very little to establish different

treatments for different kinds of badness. The only form of ‘badness’ it
demonstrates

is robbery, and even then the only real difference between the hamster and the
wolf is how much

we are implored to empathize with their emotional arc. How are we to separate
the people who are

bad without the opportunities to be good, and people who are just bad? And
provided enough emotional context, are

we being conditioned to believe that everyone can be good given the opportunity?
Are we really meant to take away that there

are no villains, only people you haven’t made friends with? Just negotiate with
fascists and find a suitable

compromise between freedom and genocide? Hixler was a sober vegetarian who liked
dogs,

you know! YEAH! To what ‘badness’ is owed empathy and

to which kind do we need to be on the lookout for? Maybe if we just give that
apparent bad guy

or rival a chance, we’ll learn that they’re not bad, and that we should
apologize for

not seeing how rough they had it in spite of the complete lack of their ability
to communicate

their hard shit. It’s OUR FAULT that we didn’t have enough

empathy. And this is on TOP of the aforementioned ‘wolf

in sheep's clothing’ trope that’s been established lately. Where you don’t know
WHO the Disney Villain

is. That it’s NOT the seemingly obvious bad

guy, but instead, the person you wouldn’t have expected. Which culminates in
this grand encouragement

to empathize with those that the public decries as a villain, but constantly be
on guard to

wait for a moment when the REAL bad guy shows their true colors. All the while
this media does very little

to establish a methodology for how to differentiate between either of those, or
to point out when

someone really is as straightforward as they seem. That person holding up a
convenience store

is likely in that situation of generational poverty regardless of their
decisions. But that person at a rally threatening violence

against trans people, immigrants, or people of color… They have made some
CHOICES. “Choices” Taking people who turn to violence or violent

rhetoric, and trying to find clues in their past to justify WHY they would do
that inherently

seeks to frame them as a victim. What was done UNTO them to MAKE them feel

this way? They are framed as a victim of a larger societal

construct. Which. Jesus christ, people— -inclined to feel that these people who
have

cake are a threat to your ability to have cake. A key component of this anger is
the fear

and outrage of a perceived victimhood, which offers a sense of righteousness
when taking

steps to righting a perceived wrong. The more this kind of focus is placed upon

analyzing these fascists as lost boys who society left behind, the more we
reinforce

these structures of self-victimization. Especially insofar as it validates a
fear

that society has forgotten about those of privilege, and to what privilege
itself is

allegedly owed. And at the end of this is the promise that

investigating why someone would want to commit to this kind of organized bigotry
would offer

some technique on how to prevent it. But granted, especially in America, there

are two ‘p-words’ — pussy, and preventative. Ben Shapiro:

“Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass P-word.” So we end up in a cultural
state where we

have no recourse for how to redirect people out of fascist circles, leading to a
collection

of trans women fighting back a cumulative nervous breakdown from their efforts
of trying

to stem the tide of this pipeline without a road map. In spite of all this
information we have,

we still know very little about how to de-radicalize people from these violent
spaces. And without the information being used — and

there is a LOT of information — to develop practical solutions to a literal
threat against

contemporary Democracy, we just have a heap of data about fascists’ emotions.
Party. We have next to no documentation about the

success rates of citizens, creators, influencers, and entertainers who are
throwing darts in

the dark to figure out what’s going to stick. And also next to no public
interest in the

people who are victims OF this hateful, violent rhetoric. Because you’d think
that in an empathic,

compassionate society, those are the people — the people whose very lives are an
affront

to fascism — to whom our interest would be drawn. But no. Let’s feed into the
privilege of people

who feel like their privilege owes them more out of life, by making everything
about their

emotions. Fascists: they’re the REAL victims of fascism

— The moral weight of their choices are the real casualties. Which is a romantic
notion, if you don’t

take into account actual fascists in real life. The hordes of SS officers being
called to

testify at Nuremberg who expressed not a feather of remorse for their actions.
And I don’t even want to blame all of our

leaders and lawmakers for not making efforts to legislate the kind of
circumstances that

could make a whole population comfortable enough to not feel like their way of
life

is at risk. Raise wages to match the cost of living, impose

rent control to force landlords to price competitively, subsidize essential
goods, generate public

options for power, water, and communications. Because there are people who are
trying to

do these things. The problem is, when it comes to a substantial

portion of the population— -anger can be a potent and necessary motivational

tool, if you spend too long being angry — getting what you want isn’t going to
make you feel

better — you just want to have your anger justified. You want permission to be
angry. Which is how you end up in situations where

the population actively resists actions that will make their lives easier. And
this can be indoctrinated through any

number of methods— usually by saying “this helpful thing is actually part of an
organization

you hate.” You hate the organization, so you hate the

thing. Coupled with a strong centrist movement that

thinks that life can be beautiful as long as you ignore anything that isn’t —
well

this is how you get fascists. MC: We have no troubles here. Here life is
beautiful! And all of this isn’t just in reference

to the Third Reich or The KKK or their sad little modern imitators. There are a
large number of groups in human

history who fought from the bottom rung of the ladder to improve their living
conditions. From slave revolts over the span of the Roman

Empire — to several waves of French peasants who, over the course of a century,
toppled

a disconnected and clueless ruling aristocracy, and changed the political
landscape of Europe

to this day. As much as we look at those battles and say:

“Yes those were righteous causes.” The Third Reich and the KKK also felt their

causes were righteous. Which brings us to today where — sigh — a

significant group of people seem to hold queer people responsible for all the
world’s problems. And not, you know, the ongoing greed-mongering,

crony-capitalist, post-colonial, nepotistic, pseudo-democratic oligarchy which
we like

to pretend passes for a society that lends power to the people. But let’s NOT
blame the people running that

show, and instead let’s blame preferred pronouns as the root of all evil.
That’s… That’s it… That… We — the left-leaning, progressive, and

socially-minded of us — typically celebrate the downtrodden and underclasses
standing

up for their own dignities. But it’s this language of ‘righteousness’

that seems to work against us at times. Righteousness is a vague term, and (I
find)

more accurately describes a kind of air that someone carries themself with,
rather than

an objective sense of doing what is right or just. Which explains a lot about
our society, actually. But it’s the specific word ‘righteous’

that messes it all up. Because while there may be — through some

ethical philosophy — an objective sense of what is truly righteous through any
singular

definition of the word… in a pragmatic sense, the word really does boil down to
perspective. For whom is justice liberation; and for whom

is justice regression? In our fights and struggles for the minorities

and second-class citizens to be recognized with dignity and respect, the
language of

our struggle did not go unnoticed. And the privileged, who celebrate heroism

and heroic deeds envy these battles and they envy our figureheads for
representing the

values they can only ascribe to their ancestors. They cannot live out these
battles in their

lifetimes — so they make a show of it. And we’ve seen this song and dance
before. We’ve heard this music, the lyrics calling

out to condemn those who barely have any rights to begin with. These songs,
these dances. They’re not new. We’ve seen them play out over and over again

on stages all around the world. These people put on a show to tell the world

how repressed they are, even though they’re in the biggest show in town. But
it’s all so hollow. Like a story written by an AI. They plagiarize our struggles
and our fights

and appropriate it into their pageantry. But our struggles, our victories, our
lives

will always outlast their theatrics — because theater is only a story… And every
story, eventually, comes to an end.
