Join YouTuber and independent filmmaker James Somerton for a discussion with his podcast partner, author N. T. Herrgott, about what it’s like to grow up queer in Canada with an American-dominated media space. Bring your questions for our speakers for this live event, which will also be live streamed on our YouTube channel. 

James Somerton began making videos as a pastime, and eventually shifted into full-time content creation in 2020. Since then, James has launched a successful IndieGoGo campaign for start-up capital to make films under his indie studio: Telos Pictures, with the first feature “Anti Social” due out In 2024.

An advocate for the importance of producing content outside of corporate oversight, Nick Herrgott develops content with a focus on media literacy and social analysis. Under the pen name N.T Herrgott, Nick has published Gentleman’s Club, a novel about a queer teenaged superhero.

There were several parts I had trouble comprehending when audience members spoke because they either didn't have a microphone or the audio quality was much poorer than for James and Nick, and so I apologize for the incomplete nature of this transcript and if parts don't make sense when that occurs. I do not do this sort of thing professionally so I also apologize for any general difficulties in reading it.

I also attempted to fact-check every statement that wasn't just a subjective opinion or feeling, including references to Canadian cultural context. Some of these were blurry but I figured it was worth doing. I also struggled to find certain information, especially if it was advanced industry know-how on certain topics. Honestly, I didn't wish to spend too much time on this and I would say my research was relatively shallow. I'm also not a filmmaker and I'm not Canadian, so I'm sure there's gaps. I apologize for that.

My TL;DR overall impression: This talk isn’t completely full of misinformation but they do make statements that are misleading or incorrect in order to paint Canada as actively hostile to its domestic creatives and independent media production, especially in the face of American cultural hegemony (not to imply that this isn’t an issue, just that some of their evidence is literally incorrect). One statement/anecdote was definitely plagiarized (a new low for something that’s a semi-improvised public talk), Ctrl+F for “werewolf” to find that.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Okay um, so one of the things we get asked a lot on in comment sections and live streams and everything, when people discover that we're Canadian is, which is, they're always shocked by, is that—

</james>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

You do have you do have a very American accent.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I did that on purpose, is why don't we ever talk about any Canadian content, or being Canadian, or queer Canadian stuff, and usually my answer is that there's not a lot to talk about but really my answer is Americans don't care and that's the majority of YouTube. So I figured today would actually be a good time to kind of focus on that a bit more um, because as Canadian queer content creators and in the process of becoming Canadian queer filmmakers that's a very, like, important thing for me is, you know, there's…

For me anyway, maybe I'm just completely underexposed to it, there's not as big a queer Canadian voice especially in like traditional filmmaking and in television and stuff like that as there is from America. Even if you watch things on like CBC, uh like Schitt's Creek, which we'll get into, that does have, like, major queer characters and storylines, it doesn't seem to get as much attention as a minor queer character on something on CBS, or something like that. And so I figured we would talk about that and why that's kind of frustrating, and how we got there, and maybe what we can do about it?

Oh yeah, whatever, what better to talk about in the nation's capital, is about being gay in Canada.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>Yeah.</james>
<credits>[Both laugh]</credits>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Uh, this is the place to have that discussion. Um, so this is something that James and I have regularly talked about on our own, uh very frequently is just this, this discussion about why, to use layman’s terms, we know basically nothing about Canadian gay rights in general. Uh, we really have to struggle to kind of think about what we know and even do, like, research. Where, when it comes to American dates like, events and dates we got that on top of our head.

</james>

{% assign timecode = "4:48" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

Oh yeah, we can give you a blow by blow of the Stonewall Riots, but ask us about like, queer rights in Canada, it's like ah, ahh, Ginger Snaps came out from like ‘99 I think. And that's that's about it.

<nick {% include timecode %}>

This is less about specifically Canadian media and more about, like, the discussion of Canadian identity. Um, but through these discussions that we have, we, I, I certainly have the idea that media certainly plays a role in that, uh, and a big role, um, and I think especially just because like, when something important happens, the modern industrial creative thinks “I should make a movie about this.” And that happens a lot for American historical events, but not so much for Canadian ones, uh, for a consolation, convolution? Is that a real word? 

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "5:39" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

I don't think it is.

</james>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

It is now. Uh, of reasons, uh, a convolution of reasons. I coined it here. Um, and I, it does start with just the structure of how media is produced, created, and distributed on this, um side of the border. Yeah, I was going to use a different word, but that's probably better.

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "6:04" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah and like, having, you know, come from a film background, it is sort of um, the, there's a weird relationship between like Canada and media, and specifically with America's media, because we are so close in culture and in geography that American media just kind of like funnels its way into Canada whether we like it or not. And so when for instance, uh, in when uh, gay marriage became legal in Canada, there wasn't a whole lot of talk about it among people that I knew at the time, and I was a teenager at the time, everyone knew I was gay but I didn't know if anyone else was. Um, but even among the adults and stuff, there was no big drama about it where I lived, there was no discussion of it. It was just something that happened.

Whereas, two, I think it was two years before, um, you know, San Francisco had started issuing marriage licenses to gay couples, and it was the biggest thing, America was going to melt down, the whole world was going to end, and everyone in the whole world-- 

</james>

</comment>
<nick>

[unintelligible, something about “hurricanes”] on that.

</nick>
<james>

Yeah [laughs]. And it's sort of like, come to my realization lately that, at least for me, and this might be different from other people, for other people I hope it is, is that when something important happens in Canada, it's almost, even as Canadians, we're kind of like “Oh that happened.”

</james>
<nick {% include timecode %}>Yeah.</nick>
</compare>
{% assign timecode = "7:31" %}

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And when something even minorly of any importance happens in the United States it's, obviously, it makes the news in Canada, it makes the news globally. We as a country I feel like, even like the queer population, we're on the edge of our seats waiting to find out when's America going to get, you know, same-sex marriage when we had already had it for several years beforehand. And it seems like much of the world was the same way, and I think it is because of this American dominated media that just kind of funnels its way into Canada, like.

</james>
{% assign timecode = "8:06" %}
<nick {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, you used that word “funnel” earlier and I maybe, think of like, it's a bit different here because I've talked to…one of that things about being someone who is tangential to an influencer, um, I still don't like using that term.

</nick>
<james crosstalk {% include timecode %}>Strong word</james>
<nick>

I don't like using that term, um who do I influence? Um… as I've had some discussions with people in Europe, and the, the idea of America being this media behemoth is not exclusive to Canada, that, that's everywhere. But it was hard to kind of articulate to him exactly what that means to be like right next to it.

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "8:41" %}
<nick {% include timecode %}>

Um, and in this specific instance, it's a friend of mine who is in the Netherlands, um, he was talking about uh, German media passing into the Netherlands, and uh, the things that he was talking about didn't quite line up with the way things exist in Canada, um, whereas our media was kind of is, you know, dwarfed next to what America puts out, at the rate it puts it out. 

Um, and that that's for a number of reasons why Canada is in this very unique position as being a same language country next to the world's largest media producer, um, because for all Germany might produce a lot of me—would output a lot more media than smaller countries around it, uh the Netherlands is only, Germany has 4 times the population of the Netherlands and America has 10 times the population of Canada.

</nick>
<comment span="2">
{% include header for=malia %}

I couldn’t find anything on how much imported German media makes up Netherland’s media consumption. I don't think Nick is lying, to be clear, I just have no info on hand.

In terms of population, the stated ratio is about correct (though underestimating it a bit): [Demographics of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany#Population_density_and_distribution) and [Demography of the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_Netherlands#Population).

This is approximately correct, it’s a little smaller than 10:1 as a ratio though currently.

Closing in on twelve now, I think.

</james>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

Um, which is sizable like, for every one Canadian, there are every, there are ten Americans and they consume a lot of media, and we consume a lot of their media. Um, so just in terms of just the sheer volume of stuff, that not only there's demand for in America, but the output for it, because America just doesn't create media for Americans, it creates media for the whole world. I mean international box offices are a big deal, um.

<james {% include timecode %}>

And it's not just America, there's lots of countries, um specifically the ones that come to mind right away are the UK and Japan, they basically create media for the whole world whereas Canadian media is very Canadian-centric, like as someone who has gone to film school in Canada and tried to get movies made the traditional way in Canada, it is nigh impossible to get something made in Canada without it being the most Canadian thing ever made.

There are multiple federal public resources for financing filmmaking in Canada, even within singular organizations (Canada Council for the Arts, Canada Media Fund, Telefilm Canada, and other organizations I’m missing), as well as tax credits. Eligibility requirements seem to differ between organizations (such as independence of production) but primarily focus on production companies being based in Canada and controlled by Canadian citizens.

I’m not sure what distinguishes Quebecois public funding practices besides residing in Quebec, but maybe I’m missing something.

There are currently 7 Canadian films (pending one for this year that would bring the total to 8) that have been nominated for Best International Feature Film. One has won. All of these were categorized as being at least partially in French and directed by Canadians who were raised in Quebec.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_submissions_for_the_Academy_Award_for_Best_International_Feature_Film 

The qualifications for a film to be eligible for Best International Feature nominations are “a feature-length motion picture (over 40 minutes) produced outside the United States of America and its territories with a predominantly (more than 50%) non-English dialogue track.” So it’s not surprising that most Canadian nominations would be Quebec-originated given the non-English language requirement, since the majority of other Canadian films are mostly in English.

And whereas, you know, in the United States, there will be movies made in the United States that take place in every country in the whole world, there'll be movies made in the UK that that happens with, in Australia that that happens with um, whereas here it's very Canadian-centric in order to get the money from the federal government grants and stuff like that. Um, Quebec kind of has its own system and that's why a lot of movies that are produced in Quebec will actually be Oscar-nominated, they will get nominated for best foreign feature [Best International Feature, formerly known as Best Foreign Language Film] and things like that whereas movies produced basically everywhere else in Canada are flatly ignored in the United States.

Something like Schitt’s Creek basically became popular in the United States by accident because it was acquired by Netflix, people in the US started watching it on Netflix, started falling in love with the characters, and the story, and the world, and everything, and they had no idea that it was Canadian. And the show, even in the end season, you know, they go to what is ostensibly Toronto or New York, but they don't say what city it is when they go to kind of pitch their idea for uh, spinning off the motel.

</james>
<comment>
{% include header for=malia %}

Schitt’s Creek was pitched to and significantly funded by CBC, but was also funded and distributed by Pop (formerly known as the TV Guide Network), an American cable channel.

https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/schitts-creek-netflix-pop-success-story.html 

Schitt’s Creek’s popularity booming after its distribution on Netflix began seems to be widely accepted knowledge.

https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/schitts-creek-emmys-when-final-season-netflix 

Schitt’s Creek’s setting was apparently intentionally made somewhat ambiguous, though it had many Canada-specific traits and was eventually confirmed as Canadian-set in 2018.

This anecdotal evidence and just my subjective opinion, but I just think this is silly to say. No one I have ever talked to or seen or read has commented that media like Scott Pilgrim and Turning Red are too Canadian to get, or have gotten so confused about Toronto that they had to stop engaging.

So we're in a very interesting position as Canadian creators, and I know in James and I mean, like we as Canadians who create things, because there are a lot of us. Most of us end up going to, I'm not good with microphones, but most of us end up uh, going to America to make, to make content, um.

As noted before, I can't find any evidence on the funding claims he makes here at all for Titanic or Avatar, and they just seem dubious to me in general.

Yeah, like something that Americans don't really, they might know it but they don't know it, is two of the highest grossing movies ever made were made by a Canadian who actually tried to get them financed in Canada, uh this is both Avatar movies and Titanic, but the Canadian government wasn't interesting, and interested in forking over you know, hundreds of millions of dollars to James Cameron to get these things made. So he went through the traditional studio system and made himself Fox, and I think Paramount—

A huge fortune! And the Canadian populace lost out on that, and we lost out on the ability to say like, that's a Canadian movie because although it was made by Canadian filmmakers, it wasn't Canadian enough. And so we're in this weird position where specifically with the film industry, the federal government does seem to work against—

And it's that phrase “Canadian enough” that really bothers me because one would assume that media content made by a Canadian would qualify as a, as Canadian content because it's content being made by someone who has grown up with the cultural sensibilities of this nation um, where many, we’re many different people but like across the country like, one of that version is Canadian. And the movie, Arrival, uh, you were telling me the other day was supposed to take place in Canada.

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "13:28" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, Denis Villeneuve, who is from Quebec, wanted that to take place in Ontario and he wanted it to make it through the Canadian system, so that he could employ Canadians and stuff like that, give back to the system that helped him get to where he was. And the federal government turned him down for the financing, so it ended up taking place in you know, generic flat American state.

So, so yeah, already like out of the gate, Canadian creators are kind of kneecapped as far as, you know, they might want to express your Canadian identity, but you can't do too much of that that because then it's not going to be accessible outside of the country. But the only way to kind of make it accessible outside of this country is to make it more vague, which, you know, doesn't really fulfill the qualifications of wanting to express a sense of what it's like to grow up in this country.

So um, there isn't a whole lot of ways for Canadians to reinforce their own national identity because content made here has to compete with content made in America, and they can produce more of it, and have, they have the the infrastructure to promote it um, at a greater rate than we can promote it here. Um, so Canadian identity connectors get, gets swept under the rug in a lot of situations. Now to have Canadians—

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "14:41" %} 
<james {% include timecode %}>

Oddly, you know, as even as the government tries to, you know, create a system where the Canadian media industry is built to enhance Canadian identity. it actually goes in the opposite direction because of the constraints put on it.

</james>
{% assign timecode = "14:57" %} 
<nick {% include timecode %}>

Yeah that's what I was trying to say, thank you, my words weren't working. Um uh, like you, yeah, the, the need to make Canadian content for Canadians is getting uh, squashed because we can't, we just can't compete with national content with American content.

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "15:15" %} 
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah um, because Canada kind of acts in a way that um, New Zealand acts with Australia. Australia has a film production industry, New Zealand has a film service industry, where Australian productions will go to New Zealand because of tax breaks and such, but also because New Zealand has a lot of people who are professionals who can work on the film sets for less money, and that's basically how Canada works for the United States.

We have a service industry that is much more popular among American filmmakers than a production industry. We do have a production industry that does make Canadian content, but when you hear of a movie being made in Canada, it's not likely going to be about Canadian issues, it's not going to star Canadians not likely um, probably not going to be written or directed by a Canadian, and we promise this is all going to come back to queer issues eventually.

Uh, well, it also limits the ability for Canadian creators to make content that isn't explicitly about Canadian, Canadian issues, or Canada itself. Like there's a diminished possibility for fantasy, or science fiction, or other genre content coming out of Canada, because you know, Star Wars doesn't take place in America, it doesn't take place in the UK, and yet that got made, but for the Canadian government to give a sign off to Canadian content it needs to be directly kind of tied to this idea of Canada.

I don’t know why they’re implying Star Wars received direct US federal funding?

https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/12/star-wars-george-lucas-independent-film 

Also again, and maybe this is something I don’t understand the complexities of, most Canadian public AV production grants/funds/etc. mainly require that productions be owned by Canadians, have significant Canadian production crew involvement, and be primarily filmed in Canada. More abstract content guidelines exist but are more focused on broader genre requirements.

<nick {% include timecode %}>

[Laughing, mumbling “maple leaf starships”?] Um, so uh already kind of out the door creators are kneecapped. Um, now to be Canadian is one thing, but to be queer and Canadian is an entirely different thing. Like that you've got even more of a kind of diminished capacity to make media as it is and like I said earlier if you want to commemorate something important that happened, you make a movie about it so that just tends not to happen, especially for queer Canadians.

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "17:20" %}

Yeah like there's, it, it actually honestly kind of shocks me that there has not been, you know, obviously not a Hollywood movie, but a Canadian movie that has been made, [glances at cellphone] apparently “Likely Fraud” is calling me, um, about the fact that in 1969 in Canada we decriminalized same-sex sex. That did not happen in the United States until 2003. So it took decades and decades in the difference between that happening between the two countries.

But I think you would be hard-pressed to be able, asking a queer person in the United States like what year did, uh I can't remember what it was called now uh, Lawrence v Texas what year did that go through the Supreme Court they can tell you it's 2003. If you ask you know, most queer Canadians what year was um homosexuality decriminalized in Canada I don't think most of us could tell you

I know that before Stonewall uh, there were several riots in America that had several queer bar, uh, raid riots that happened in America, and some in Canada too even earlier. Um, and it's also not like Canada doesn't have any shortage of weird queer stories in our history like—

It is true various LGBTQ+ bar raids occurred in the US before Stonewall (1969).

https://www.advocate.com/politics/2017/3/01/30-infamous-police-raids-gay-bars-and-bathhouses#rebelltitem27 

Various raids of gay establishments such as bars, nightclubs, and bathhouses did take place before 1969. However, it seems to be generally accepted though that the first public LGBTQ+ protest in Canada was in 1971, but maybe I'm missing something.

Well there's a shockingly undocumented history of police violence against queer people in Canada that goes back like, just as back as far back as United States one does, and we and we all know about the Stonewall riots and everything, we don't know about the riots that happen in Montreal, we don't know about the riots that happened in Toronto, and we don't talk about these things and it might be that we want to kind of act like you know, Canada is above it all and that “Oh, there are no you know big issues in Canada” when it comes to you know like uh race relations, and uh indigenous rights, and queers’ rights and stuff like that like “Oh we figured that out long ago we don't have to talk about it now,” even though it's like no, no.

So this is actually a subplot of a queer horror novel, Red X, by a gay, Canadian writer, David Demchuk (published in 2021). There are elements of real Canadian history present, such as Alexander Wood, a Canadian merchant, originally from Scotland, who was caught up in a sex scandal and accused of sodomy in 1810. But the “twinkie boyfriend” and werewolf elements are fictional and created by Demchuk.

Uh yeah, when it was Upper and Lower Canada, um there was a Scottish gentleman that um, basically came across over to Canada, he was kicked out of Scotland for being gay and he came over with his twinkie boyfriend. And as the legend basically goes, they moved into a like, manor house in Ontario—

You know, it's, I think I feel like a part of it is our, as a country's fault, that we do have this really interesting, these really interesting pieces of queer history in Canada, um, that we don't brag about.

He is referring to changes to Policy 713, a set of standards for how New Brunswick schools should treat LGBTQ+ students. Specifically, there’s a lot of controversy around not mandating teachers to use a student’s preferred name and pronouns if the student is under 16 as well as pushing for (though not necessarily requiring) parental consent to do so formally.

Legally, marriage is a federal status which grants participants the same legal rights no matter what region of Canada they live in, while common-law is a provincial status, and thus what rights and privileges participants have can vary depending on provincial law. There are advantages and disadvantages to choosing either.

In 2010, before same-sex marriage was legalized, Obama issued a memorandum requesting that the Department of Health and Human Services create more equitable and non-discriminatory rules for hospitals that participated in Medicare or Medicaid. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released their rules which required eligible hospitals to provide patients the right to choose who may visit them, have written visitation policies, and grant equal rights for all allowed visitors

Despite these rules, some hospitals still discriminated against unmarried partners of patients. And obviously, if a hospital was 100% private and did not participate in Medicaid or Medicare, these rules did not apply.

Of course, the federal legalization of same-sex marriage in the US in 2015 doesn’t mean there are now no more unfair barriers for unmarried partners or other parties involved in caring for a patient that aren’t reliant on the legal contract of marriage or other legally recognized forms of dependence/intimacy/family. However, the disproportionate impact on LGBTQ+ people at the time is pretty obvious, I think, and while I agree with Nick on the principle, I don’t fault certain groups’ activism for focusing on the more materially simpler bridge of same-sex marriage rights.

And that was, that was actually, I remember when Juno first came out, like every Canadian being like, “Oh, this is a Canadian movie, look at all the Americans watching the Canadian movie” and that was a movie the Canadian government refused to fund, even though it had a Canadian, mostly Canadian cast, Canadian director, Canadian producers, they had to go to America, getting America to get the money, and then it made a couple hundred million dollars and won some Oscars.

There was a bit of controversy at the time of awards season that Juno wasn’t deemed Canadian enough for the Genies because of its American funding (though apparently it was just never submitted for the Genies). It did still win two Canadian Comedy awards.

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/canadian-comedy-awards-fetes-jason-120364/ 

Also Juno did make 232 million dollars at the box office.

https://web.archive.org/web/20230607000909/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2539488769/ 

I can’t find anything about people requesting Canadian government funding for Juno, only that many American studios thought the premise was too controversial and risky to make. Ultimately, it was produced by two American companies, Mr. Mudd and Mandate Pictures.

https://web.archive.org/web/20080528103051/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20007870_20164475_20175163_3,00.html 

In general, this doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to me because the origins of Juno are that Diablo Cody, an American writer, wrote the screenplay at the urging of an American talent agent as a sample script, and then that script was sent along to Jason Reitman. This doesn’t make the possibility of requesting Canadian financial assistance completely impossible, just not as intuitive as Somerton makes it sound.

I don’t know why Canada is being brought up regarding Aliens. Obviously James Cameron wrote and directed it, but besides that it stayed with the same American production and distribution companies that Alien had. Also Aliens was filmed mostly in England.

Maybe there’s secret missing context/info I’m missing here, but I don’t know why the Canadian government would’ve been involved at all.

A discussion about a bureaucratic board of politicians deciding what is—

<comment span="5">
{% include header for=malia %}

I think they are talking about the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which does state that one of their goals is to “ensure that Canadian broadcasting content meets the needs and interests of Canadians by delivering compelling, high-quality Canadian-made creative content from diverse sources on a variety of platforms.” The policies and system they’ve developed are called “CanCon” colloquially.

https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/cancon.htm

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content 

There is also a bill recently passed in 2023 called Bill C-11 (or the Online Streaming Act) that is intended to regulate digital and social media platforms (this including streaming platforms) similarly to how the CRTC already regulates TV and radio broadcast in Canada. The stated goal is to get these platforms to support and promote Canadian content (as it qualifies under CanCon) to Canadian users. This is a fairly controversial bill. The exact details and logistics have yet to be announced.

There is a separate bill, the Online News Act, that was also passed in 2023 that intended to make social media companies compensate domestic Canadian news publishers for reposting/aggregating their news content (targeted at Google and Facebook/Meta). This has resulted in these companies, particularly Facebook/Meta blocking direct access to Canadian news on their platforms.

<comment>
{% include header for=malia %}

ReBoot was produced in Canada by Canadian animation studios and production companies, though I will note that its creators were all British people who moved to Vancouver for production because the costs were cheaper.

It’s stated that production of ReBoot began in 1991, though I can’t find an exact, reliable citation for that. It did begin airing on YTV in 1994.

https://retrofiedmag.com/the-oral-history-of-reboot-tvs-cgi-pioneer/

https://computeranimationhistory-cgi.jimdofree.com/reboot-1994/ 

I’m not totally sure what Nick is referring to here re: Pixar, as it began as the “Computer Division” of Lucasfilm in 1979 and then Steve Jobs financed and spun it out as a separate company from Lucasfilms in 1986, because Lucas needed money for a divorce settlement. It was after this separation that the company became Pixar. For several years, the company had significant financial struggles (despite industry and critical acclaim for its graphics software and short films in the 1980s) until the release of Toy Story in 1995 in collaboration with Disney.

This is to say, Lucas was not the person who conceptualized Pixar as an artistic digital animation studio/production company. Pixar as Pixar did not exist while he was in charge. His financial struggles at the time were also not because so few people believed in the profitability of digital animation. The story of how Pixar entered digital animation as a studio is incremental and complex, and does include its time as a part of Lucasfilms, but I think Nick’s framing of Pixar’s origins is incorrect.

They’re joking obviously, but the implication is that the CanCon guidelines are content-driven in an abstract, nationalist sense, when they’re more about the production team and financing being Canadian-based.

I don’t want to completely dismiss that Nick’s novel was disqualified from Canadian literary awards due to this, but I had a hard time finding any Canadian awards that specifically disqualify books for being set outside of Canada. Most of the disqualifying elements that would apply to Nick’s novel, Gentleman’s Club, are attributes such as it being a full-length YA novel, it being his only published work, being self-published, Nick (likely) not being from an award’s respective regional focus (British Columbia, Quebec, etc.), and other factors.

The main award I found that the book could’ve been potentially eligible for and doesn’t rule out non-Canadian-set stories was the Amazon Canada First Novel Award, but I genuinely may have missed something. And I did not check every winner and nominee for that one, but I did find that while the vast majority of them are set in Canada, it’s not exclusively so.

Because we can talk about like, developmental producers and stuff, and like, they may say look at Canadian content and say like, “Oh there's just no, no call, not much call for that here.” Um, but time and time again, it's kind of proven correct that executives generally follow trends, and they don't really know why things work the way that they do. Um, so is it just because there hasn't really been a good attempt of promoting a Canadian story or Canadian content outside of Canada, because the stuff that's made here can't compete, uh, financially like in terms of budget and quality with stuff that's produced in America, um—

{% include header for=malia %}

I’m not exactly sure what qualifies for here, but looking up the executive producers of Schitt’s Creek (two of which were also main actors on the show), a little over half of them did sign deals for new projects after the show ended (Eugene Levy, Dave Levy, David West Read, and Andrew Barnsley).

Of the other three (Fred Levy, Ben Feigin, and Kevin White), Fred has only produced Schitt’s Creek, White has been an EP for other Canadian TV shows (Kim’s Convenience, Strays) but didn’t pop up in any particularly new reports, and Feigin passed away in 2022.

So it’s a mixed bag? I would say it’s not true to say they haven’t gotten any Hollywood deals though.

And there was a hot minute right after um, Schitt’s Creek won like every Emmy for its final season that um, the federal Liberals were talking about changing the Heritage laws, the Heritage Act, so that more generally produced content could be funded in Canada, and then the pandemic happened and that just went away, um.

The Emmys ceremony when Schitt’s Creek won would’ve been in September, 2020 and I couldn’t find specific news on this within a 2018-2021 timeframe, besides the previously mentioned bills that regulate online platforms. But I very well could’ve missed something more local or casual.

Also Telos is gone because it was revealed to be kind of a scam.

Maybe someday. Um, but, you know, until then, that is one thing that, you know, little self-promotion, Telos, our production company, is actually making, we're going into production in, in 2024, of a movie that is, again, doesn't take place in a Canadian city, but it is starring Canadians, it's written and produced by Canadians, directed by Canadians, and takes place in Canada, but there's not going to be any maple leafs flying around or anything like that, but it is Canadian media, queer Canadian media that will be put out there, and you know, just to test the waters and see if there there is an audience for that, because I think there is.

I, I think the digital age and the democratization of media that has come through the ability to self-promote and self-create things, like with Vivziepop, um, and a lot of other independent creators is learning that there is a large audience for a lot of stuff that has been formerly had its nose turned up. Um, so I think that there is probably a sizable market for a lot of the stuff that we're talking about should exist, just because like if, and this is kind of why what my philosophy with writing like, there's always a question like “Oh my god what if no one cares about what I'm writing about?” Um, if you care about it, you're not so independent and unique that nobody else is going to care about it also. There's going to be someone a lot of people out there who have the same wants and then desires as you do.

That's the word! Question time!

Like, at the same time, same hand, we can't compare ourselves against American victories, we can't compare ourselves against American failures, but at the same time, we can't put Canada on a pedestal.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, like I the only time that I'm like “Oh, this is Canadian,” is when I can tell it's been produced following the heritage laws because it's got all the specific things. Um, but I think with something like music, it's, there's a much lower barrier to entry, so to, you know, produce a record costs, you know, a percentage of what it would cost to make a movie or a TV show—

Not to mention that, but radio is very localized like when it comes to FM and AM stations like you get a, a much narrower um, scope of how this, uh, how those signals kind of travel, as opposed to film distribution across the world which is y’know, trucks and, I guess now, email, um…

</james>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

<james {% include timecode %}>

Um, yeah, so it is a much lower barrier to entry for music, and I think that there's kind of a democratization going on now with, you know, like, TikTok, and with YouTube, and stuff like that where you don't need half a million dollars to make something and send it out there, and you can kind of do what we kind of did, which was just be Canadian, and have Canadian perspectives on things, and kind of trick people into paying attention to you, and—

Okay so, to just summarize that, uh, it was a first a statement kind of questioning, uh, the ways that white queer, uh, what the white, specifically gay male identity dominates a lot of the mediascape and stays around, whereas other identities, and especially, I, I want to kind of elaborate that, other people of color are also kind of ignored, and kind of pushed away, like um…well, I’ll get to that later. And then the second one was a question about…[muttering] what was the question?

{% assign timecode = "55:30" %}

Yeah, um. Uh, to answer the first one, we've actually got some videos planned coming up in the fall and the early winter, um, because I've been noticing that too. Um—

</james>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

And that’s something I’ve—

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Kind of, with my kind of business school/media hat, I know why it's happening and I feel like I need to make a video explaining why it's happening, so people can kind of, change, and hopefully change their trajectory on stuff, um.

</james>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

And that's something I actually feel fairly cynically about, is like kind of why the gay male has dominated so absolutarianly of a media landscape. Um, but then again—

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "56:12" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

Like specifically because if you ask—

</james>

</credits>
{% assign timecode = "56:43" %}
<nick {% include timecode %}>

I actually have heard that recently too, lesbians who kind of hoard their, like, fanfic, like gay, um, gay male, gay boy stories. Um, I, I haven't dug that deep into it, but as for me, I just, like I also find everyone outside of the gay male identity is like, almost caricatured, or stereotyped, like, you get asexual or non-binary people who are basically, essentially robots.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah.

</james>
{% assign timecode = "57:09" %}
<nick {% include timecode %}>

Um, and I, I find that when it's in the identity outside of just uh, the main one, not the main one, the one that everyone seems to care about, oh that's also equally as bad, um, it is very caricatured, and I think that that's a problem because it makes it very difficult for people like those to exist in real life without coming under, without challenging expectations, which is exhausting.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And as for your second question, um, at least for me, I grew up in a really small town, and so it was this really weird kind of thing, where I kind of didn't know that gay people existed, but I knew I liked boys, and there wasn't like, the realization of it until, I can't remember what, I think it was the movie, Kiss Me Guido, my mom rented it, and I was, and we were watching it and I was like [gasps] okay!

So I, um, I sadly will probably never be able to think of a “ring of keys” moment that I’ve had, because me being fairly neurodivergent, I just, social cues [gestures] right over my head, so I never would have picked up on that if I would have met anyone, um…that said, I think my earliest exposure to queerness was Some Like It Hot, uh, the movie, uh the first one, um, back when you could still put that in movies without being political. Um, uh, uh, and I think I also saw The Birdcage fairly early on too but—

</nick>
<comment span="3">
{% include header for=malia %}

“Ring of keys” is likely referring to the eponymous song from the Broadway musical adaptation of Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home in which a young Alison sees a butch lesbian wearing a ring of keys at a diner and feels validated for the first time and feels like she’s found someone else like her. Or it could be referring to that original scene in the graphic novel.

https://genius.com/Original-broadway-cast-of-fun-home-ring-of-keys-lyrics  

I don’t think there’s been a notable remake of Some Like It Hot ever? It might’ve been a mixing up of words or something, but I’m not sure what Nick meant by that.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053291/fullcredits 

There are two versions of The Birdcage, but he’s probably referring to the 1996 American remake with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.

<james {% include timecode %}>

There’s one, there’s basically one place to be distributed.

</james>
<comment span="5">
{% include header for=malia %}

Cineplex is the dominant movie theater chain in Canada, with reports saying it makes up about 75% of the movie theaters. In comparison, while I couldn’t find a solid percentage for US theater chains, even the most dominant theater chain (AMC) is not nearly as monopolizing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4471116-cineplex-appears-overlooked-as-many-canadians-focussed-on-amc

https://www.boxofficepro.com/giants-of-exhibition-2023/ 

I cannot speak at all to the costs of obtaining film distribution in conventional venues such as cinemas. Obviously, the very basic outline of the traditional process is for a distributor to buy the rights for a film, and then they sell that film to theaters (or streaming platforms, or other venues/platforms) to screen it. I would assume James is generally correct here, only in that a single theater chain comprising that much of a country’s movie screens does lead to homogeneity in what they are willing to buy and screen, but I truly don’t know.

One place to be distributed.

<james {% include timecode %}>

Whereas in America, you have, I mean, just in, like a block on New York City, you have five different theater chains, whereas Cineplex basically has the monopoly in Canada. There are some like, small art house theaters which will show like, second run movies and stuff but like—

</james>
{% assign timecode = "1:00:00" %}
<nick {% include timecode %}>

They're going away.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, they're dying off and basically everything is Cineplex. So you need to, be able to have the money to be able to get into a Cineplex theater, and that isn't very easy to do when—you first you need like, quite a bit of money, so in order to do that, you basically need in Canada, you need the government funding, and so that's kind of…you’re out of luck there, unless you've got some angel investor in Dubai or something who's just throwing money at you, um.

I think what he means by this is that there are no Canadian film distributors that distribute on a wide international scale, say Warner Bros. Pictures and Universal Pictures which are American companies that have multiple international distribution branches. As far as I could tell, most Canadian distributors distribute either domestic-made films or international films, but don’t have the same kind of reach. The only one I could find that seemed to distribute internationally is Entertainment One (eOne).

Yeah, because there are like in the United States, there are tons of distribution companies that will find a way to put your movie into theaters, specifically because you need a specific theatrical run to be eligible for Oscars, um, and so if they think your movie's good enough, they need to get you into at least one week in New York and LA in order to be considered for Oscars. Um, whereas like…so there's a ton of different distribution companies that can, that can do that, and then there's, you know, home video and streaming and stuff like that, whereas in Canada there's really not a whole lot of distribution companies.

There are actually other Canadian film distributors, just in general and not necessarily on the scale of the biggest American distributors, but they do exist and still are running, including eOne, levelFILM, Elevation Pictures, Entract Films, H264, Sphere, and others. There is also the National Film Board of Canada, which also distributes films.

I won’t dispute the claims about Germany publicly funding films about the Holocaust. Germany has quite a bit of public funding available for films in general (including international productions) and it is known that Germany has a lot of active, public memorialization of the victims and impact of the Holocaust. So it would make sense for these two factors to go together. But I can’t find a definitive record on films about the Holocaust funded by the German government.

When it comes to Canadian funding, there have been publicly funded films that have also covered issues such as residential schools and missing and murdered indigenous women. In general, there are multiple indigenous-made films about indigenous lives and cultures of Canada that were publicly funded. In general, there are public grants and funds specifically dedicated to financing indigenous filmmaking. This is not to say there aren’t still problems of equity and support, but it’s not nothing either.

And you're right about the the graves, is that it's nothing that you hadn't already heard about, if you weren't listening to the right people, but like, it's like I, you had this very visceral, visual symbol of something that had been happening, that, there wasn't even really a denial, it just wasn't paid attention to. Um, and so like, is that another reason why Canada just doesn't develop, develop its own content? Because there's this kind of fixation on pretending like our history doesn't exist.

</nick>
{% assign timecode = "1:06:02" %}
<james {% include timecode %}>

But like, like I said again, it's basically, CanCon is basically Canadian propaganda. Uh, it is like, a very nice word for Canadian propaganda. Not all of it, some of it's actually, really good, but this, most of the stuff from the government is very, that the government will fund is very laudatory of Canada. Um, and so, you know, talking about the, you know, the native school children and the graves, and the stuff like that, they—even though that's something that is like, you know, what I think Americans, and you know, British people, and everyone around the world, that's something they'd be interested in knowing, and…but we are very squeamish to admit that we did anything wrong [Nick interrupts and start to speak and then stops] and I'm kind of like, Germany produces movies about the Holocaust, but we are just very much like, “Yeah, yeah, look Justin Trudeau has the pride flag!”

## Audience Talk

[Important note for the following part of the transcript:

So an audience member starts speaking at length for quite a while, and though I can hear them better than the other times audience members have spoken, it’s still only around 60% legible to me and not good enough to discern what they’re saying word for word or to summarize.

As a matter of transparency, I will leave up the text of the automatically generated Youtube transcription with some attempted passing corrections/edits (which I will underline), sources for what they’re talking about when relevant, and indications when someone else is speaking, but I haven’t cleaned up the sentences to be more coherent because I wouldn’t even know where to start.

The duration of this is 1:07:19 - 1:15:01 and the start/end of this segment is bolded if you would prefer to skip it]

from the 90s so I was literally just like we're not ending as a not talking about Kids in the Hall because um again I agree I was young people so again also I realized generational like I grew up at a time where there's no social media all we could watch yeah and we commonly knew one of the Canadians Canadian food because like they're Canadians we're always doing that

and I know it's part of the generational things as new social media and most of everyone that lives in a bubble has no idea that anything anything because no one knows anything's anything anymore because everyone's speaking their own thing but um [Kids in The Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kids_in_the_Hall) was so I mean there's stuff in it now that’s not great but um

so so Not only was it political it exposed us a lot to really serious issues happening in the country like Kids in the Hall at its time and its prime was so amazing. Y’know like I mean they had the whole segment of “Screw you taxpayer” they didn't like why is being funded by the government like I mean like being so many things um

so I realized part of part of I have different opinions on things because I've watched this very closely because um I'm somebody who does anti racism training anti-oppression training the issue of history I think is very very neat but also I'm somebody who grew up we, we watched so many things about indigenous communities a lot of things are still being produced it's just that no one knows because maybe now partly generationally forever we don't actually consume what's being produced so it's like again part of it has to be like

so for example like when I'm thinking of really interesting content that's actually been popular abroad I'm thinking of [Baroness von Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_von_Sketch_Show) which is like the closest thing I've seen to something that's like Kids in the Hall but also kind of like such a female content or sort of which was hilarious for me to watch as a Canadian I remember I was watching me like “Why do I recognize the showrunners?” look they're friends with my best friend

{% assign timecode = "1:11:06" %}
<credits {% include timecode %} header="Audience-member:">

[more things I can’t hear] like but Canadians don't, the English Canadians don’t watch Canadian film and when I think about like the films I had to watch that anywhere Canadians like in the 80s and 90s I was like these films are such pretentious art house crap and like I love my pretentious art house crap like it was bad except [Atom Egoyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_Egoyan) films right um 

I love you know which so when you actually start looking closely this dusting station around the camera I don't actually believe that I think the reality is that a lot of times people are making stuff that's not necessarily very accessible or not a lot of many things

which I actually think maybe because I just live my whole life in such a government town is because I actually do think our country doesn't necessarily want us to have or like if I more complicated conversations around things um so for example if you look at the situation with like um intermediate for example that literally won awards in Korea

I don't know people know this but like they know people who are easily there okay like like um but it would velocity was cut off because of such ridiculousness and you know related to PVC and whole Toronto the deeply incestuous Toronto act you know industry scene so I think some things have to do with hardly even the incestuousness of a lot of things so much is like little little empires little people yeah

but another issue is also do English-speaking Canadians want to conceive being a Serene because part of what you're talking about is also people need to want to see Canadian stories for Canadian stories if so many Canadians don't think it's important to do that and aren't even really interested in their history

because part of what I was listening to what I realized that because I'm not white I've actually sought out so much more Canadian content and literature because so many people who are not white are also queer and produce all this like content in Canada but if you're not from those communities you're not seeking out like it's because we seek it out

Unsure what serial killer they’re talking about.

and part of it might just be the nepotism of just lot of people who are not very diverse don't understand how people watch things because I would say a lot of these stories are great if you're breaking love but also particularly stories that involve people who are not white so basically something you can't get from America

like it tends to be in situation like the sort of situation are actually going to make a bunch of money internationally but I do think there's a lack of will not just because they go on a finance but because they actually the people making decisions is such an incestuous group of limited amount of people that they don't actually want to do that

<nick {% include timecode %}>

I think that we are sitting on the precipice of like, 15 or more very serious media related problems, and that's why I have such a hard time having these discussions is because it's like, okay which one you focus on? How do you talk about how they all interact with each other? And so when it comes to, I really like, what you said about, um, you said a lot [laughs] um, what she said about the way that there isn't an interest in it or like, you know, the powers that be don't want to push that, and they don't want people to think about that, and the thing about propaganda is, Pulp Fiction versus Forrest Gump.

While not an exact or objective metrics of legacy or current discourse, Forrest Gump has over 2.5 million views on Letterboxd and over 2 million ratings on IMDB. It was also chosen for the United States National Film Registry.

{% assign timecode = "1:15:37" %}
<nick {% include timecode %}>

Um, who, who talks about Forrest Gump these days? You have one movie that is basically celebrating American identity to the point of fetishization, and another movie that is challenging America and the concept of America in an incredibly subversive way. Um, the good stories are always more subversive, they're always more challenging. When stories conform to existing narratives of power they pass off for propaganda really easily. 

</nick>

<compare>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

So, of course, a body within the government, that their sole mandate is to promote the objective of the government, isn't going to approve stories that challenge the government, or the establishment powers, because then that would be approving its own defeat, um, and that's kind of where I go for on that tangent. But, um, in terms of, about audiences, and, you know, people being interested in, especially on different like, race lines or something, it is a matter of like, what people have exposure to. Like I said about reading I, I don't consume media very quickly, so I have to be very selective about that, so I'm going to gravitate towards media that I heard about, and I don't really have any social circles, um.

Yeah, well like that, that's one of the 15 issues that's kind of tackling into this, it's like, we're living in a very difficult time and breaking these patterns is going to be difficult, and that's why I focus less about Canadians creating things because I'm sure there are so many Canadians that are doing really amazing things under the Canadian flag and doing it very well, but because they don't have the ability to compete with American distribution, American advertising, American airwaves, especially American media's domination over the Internet, which is something I don't think there's a whole lot of research into, but I think there needs to be.

Like, the, I am convinced that the fact that there has not been a, like, a series about the Bruce McArthur murders is because of what the people he killed looked like. Like, there is a, there's a Netflix series, it's a docu-series and those murders got a two-parter in it. People were talking about it all over Twitter and there is like nothing about it in Canada, and it's, I think again, that sort of propaganda idea of “Oh, we don't want to talk about that because that makes us look racist and bad,” and it's like, or you can point out “Yes—”

James is talking about a series of murders by Bruce McArthur (a white gay man) that took place in 2010 - 2017 in Toronto that targeted gay and queer men. Most of the victims were of Central and South Asian descent. The Netflix series he’s referring to would be the second season of Catching Killers in 2022.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), a public broadcaster, has helped produce and air multiple media pieces on the murders, including documentaries, a podcast series, and a docudrama series.
