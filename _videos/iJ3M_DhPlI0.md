As the second world war ended and masses of servicemen returned home to America having spent almost *all* of their time away exclusively with other men, there seemed to be an opening of the minds of the American populace when it came to homosexuality. Not that it was an *acceptable* alternative to heterosexuality now, but that it wasn't the *worst* thing in the world, usually under the caveat that it would be something a man would grow out of.<sup cn></sup> How Italian.

But politicians who did not serve their country in Europe or the South Pacific did not see this new momentary mindset as a good thing. Instead they saw it as a corrupting influence on America's men, just as bad if not worse than the ghostly specter of communism they feared would make its way to the United States after American boys spent so much time with Russians over in Europe. 

And so began the Red Scare in Washington DC, as politicians led a crusade against actual and perceived communists working within the Beltway. And it didn't take long for them to broaden their scope to include actual and perceived *homosexuals* as well with almost 5,000 gay people having lost their jobs in Washington by the end of the scare. The Lavender Scare became a witch hunt for boogeyman just as terrifying as the communists. And as Washington took aim at suspected communists in Hollywood, suspected *homosexuals* in Hollywood were added to the growing Blacklist.

In the early 20th century, the United States experienced a period of political persecution and anxiety known as the "Red Scare". There were two different eras in American history that are collectively known as the Red Scare, both of which were marked by widespread anxiety over communism and other leftist ideas. The first Red Scare happened in the wake of World War One and is rarely spoken about. And the second occurred in the midst of the Cold War in the late 1940s and early 1950s. 

To a considerable extent, the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was to blame for the onset of the *first* Red Scare. It's no secret that many Americans, especially those in positions of authority, were worried about the emergence of the Soviet Union and the expansion of communism in Europe. In response to this perceived threat, the American government enacted a set of laws *intended* to limit the freedoms of those who were either Communists or sympathizers of the Communist cause.

<james {% include timecode %}>

The Sedition Act of 1918 was one of the most notorious pieces of legislation enacted at the time, because it made it a crime to *criticize* is the government. Anyone suspected of being a Communist or Anarchist was subject to prosecution under these statutes, regardless of whether or not they had committed any real crimes. The American Protective League was one of the several *private* groups formed during the first Red Scare with the authority to investigate and report on suspected subversives.

<james {% include timecode %}>

During the height of the Red Scare, the American Legion spearheaded a drive to identify and punish suspected traitors. After World War II, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union grew once again, sparking the second Red Scare. During this time, communism was again considered a major danger to American democracy and its way of life. The inquiry undertaken by Senator Joseph McCarthy, known as the McCarthy hearings, was one of the most important events of the second Red Scare.

McCarthy claimed to have a list of people who were either Communist party members or sympathizers. And he used his position in government to initiate a series of investigations and interrogations to flush them out. Dramatic confrontations and high profile charges typified the McCarthy hearings, which had far-reaching effects on American culture. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Many individuals were punished for their suspected Communist links, even though there was no proof to back up the claims. Witnesses were questioned under duress throughout the trials to get them to identify other Communists who were under suspicion. Even if they were judged not to be Communist supporters, many people were blacklisted and lost their employment as a consequence of the proceedings. 

Because of McCarthy and his associates harsh methods and disregard for due process, the hearings became notorious. But the hearings came to an end in 1954 when McCarthy was censured by the senate for his conduct during the investigations. Marking the beginning of the end of McCarthy's political career, the hearings are now widely viewed as a dark chapter in American history.

In the State Department alone, security officials boasted that on average they were firing one homosexual per day, more than double the rate for those suspected of political disloyalty.<sup>2</sup>

Cohn did not insist his doctors treat him for liver cancer; he told the public (and basically everyone else) that he had liver cancer. He did not undergo cancer treatments. There's no evidence that AZT destroyed his liver either; though AZT *can* cause liver damage, the only medical conditions mentioned in the biography *Citzen Cohn* are Kaposi sarcoma, anemia, and dementia, and his ultimate cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest (as well as dementia and complications from AIDS).

<comment {% include commenter for=tobi %}>

In regards to Hoover, there are many rumors about his sexuality, and historians have a variety of opinions. Notably, the author of *The Lavender Scare*, David K. Johnson, dismisses the speculation that Hoover was gay as a "homophobic fantasy", and claims that if there were really any evidence, it would have lead to Hoover's immediate dismisal in a political climate where merely associating with a gay person was grounds for persecution. He also notes, "Like most men and women in 1950s America, Hoover saw homosexuality not as an inborn characteristic of a percentage of the population, but a sin or temptation to which anyone might succumb" and "Imposing present-day notions of sexuality — particularly the notion that persons are essentially born either heterosexual or homosexual — back onto this period further distorts our understanding." (Johnson 11-12)

<mark>The HUAC hearings failed to turn up any evidence that Hollywood was secretly disseminating Communist propaganda, but the industry was nonetheless transformed.</mark> The fallout from the inquiry was a factor in the decision by Floyd Odlum, the primary owner of RKO Pictures, to leave the industry.<sup>[30]</sup> As a result, the studio passed into the hands of Howard Hughes. Within weeks of taking over in May 1948, Hughes fired most of RKO's employees and virtually shut the studio down for six months as he had the political sympathies of the rest investigated. Then, just as RKO swung back into production, Hughes made the decision to settle a long-standing federal antitrust suit against the industry's Big Five studios. This was one of the crucial steps in the collapse of the studio system that had governed Hollywood for a quarter-century.

The echoes of McCarthyism were sounding loudly in the Hollywood Hills, and the association between gay and communist were inseparable by then. And as mentioned in previous episodes, Hollywood was more or less stuffed full of gay men and women working in any one of a multitude of roles in the industry. This resulted in multiple well-respected directors moving to Europe and sending many more up-and-coming and well-established actors even further into the closet.

Suddenly films about the fear of extraterrestrials became hot tickets in Hollywood as a narrative device to help instill fear of anything even slightly different to the masses of the growing Suburban America. These monsters from outer space were communists, gays, and people of color. These aliens could be *anything and everything* John and Martha were afraid of, which (thanks to Senator McCarthy) was a lot of things.

But no theme was more prevalent than the alien shapeshifter, the ones who could live alongside the normal people, corrupting them from within. Communists coming for your husbands. Gays coming for your sons.

The Red Scare and the dread of Communist infiltration into American culture are commonly seen as metaphors in the 1956 science fiction classic *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*. The film has also been seen as a homosexual allegory by any number of reviewers and scholars throughout the years. 

The film's narrative revolves around an extraterrestrial invasion of Earth and the subsequent infiltration of soulless carbon copy humans developed in pods. The pod inhabitants begin to symbolize, as the film unfolds, a society that is driven by uniformity and tries to eliminate individuality and uniqueness. This uniformity and conformity theme has been linked to the gay experience in the 1950s ever since. Many gay individuals in the past were pressured to conceal their identities and mask their sexual orientation because of the widespread stigma associated with being gay at the time. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The film's depiction of the pod people paints them as robotic drones devoid of feeling and individuality. In addition, the film's characters are a misfit crew that the perceived conventional society rejects and ignores. People who *insist* that something nefarious is occurring are sometimes branded as insane or paranoid. Similar to the experiences of gay people, who were frequently disregarded and mocked by the larger society, the characters in this story are members of a minority group who are trying to persuade the world of a threat that only they can see. 

*Invasion of the Body Snatchers* is undoubtedly a film that reflects the societal anxieties of its time and can also be seen as a powerful gay allegory. By exploring themes of conformity, individuality, and marginalization, the film speaks to the experiences of many gay people who struggle to find acceptance in a society that sought to erase their differences.

*Invaders from Mars* features a similar plot to *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*. David, the film's protagonist, is a creative and sensitive young man who is ridiculed and excluded from school. He has a difficult time relating to people, even his own father, with whom he has a tense relationship. Many members of the queer community, especially around the time the film was released, have experienced feelings of alienation and exclusion *similar* to those shown in the film. 

Actor Arthur Franz, who plays David's father in the film, has been speculated to be homosexual in real life. Morris Ankrum, who was also thought to be gay, plays Dr. Kelston, an investigator of the UFO phenomena. There are aspects in *Invaders from Mars* that... *may* be seen via a queer lens, even if that wasn't the film's original intent. From the underlying ties between the male characters, to the overt themes of possession and invasion.

<mark>The 1939 film, *Ninotchka* has also been interpreted by film critics as an allegory for *lesbian* desire and love.</mark> Firstly the character of Nina, played by Greta Garbo, is a stern and serious Soviet envoy, who comes to Paris to supervise a group of three bumbling comrades who have been sent there to sell jewels seized during the Russian Revolution. Nina is *initially* portrayed as cold and unfeeling. But she begins to thaw as she falls in love with the charming and carefree Count Léon d'Algou, played by Melvyn Douglas. 

This dynamic of a strict and buttoned up woman being seduced by a more carefree and flamboyant man is a common trope in classic Hollywood films. But it also mirrors the expectation that more "manly" or serious women would lighten up and go straight eventually. The assumption among many was, after all, that the only thing stopping a lesbian from being a happy homemaker was finding the *right* man.

Finally there is the character of Irma, played by Bela Lugosi, Irma is portrayed as a flamboyant and theatrical figure with a campy and exaggerated manner of speaking and gesturing. While the character is not explicitly identified as queer, the fact that Lugosi himself was bisexual and often played roles with homoerotic undertones has led some viewers to interpret Irma as a coded representation of queer desire.

It's unclear why James is talking about this film in this video, since it came out well before the Red Scare/Lavender Scare. Also, I couldn't find any evidence that Lugosi himself was bisexual. I also couldn't find any documentation of Bela Lugosi's character in *Ninotchka*, Commander Razinin, being called Irma. (Or Urma, or Erma.) It's a female name anyway. And when James describes him as "flamboyant," "theatrical," and "exaggerated," he's just standing there in a plain uniform with a hand on his hip, talking with very little movement or expression. Did he write this using ChatGPT?

And from a completely opposite direction, we have the notorious *Plan 9 from Outer Space*, from the infamous filmmaker Ed Wood. While the film has long been considered a cinematic disaster, it has also been celebrated for its campy subversive qualities. In particular, many critics and scholars have interpreted the film as a queer allegory. 

One way in which the film can be seen as a queer allegory is through the character of the alien leader Eros. Eros is portrayed as a flamboyant effeminate figure with his *distinctive* attire, makeup, and mannerisms. He moves with a graceful almost balletic quality, and his speech is melodramatic and theatrical. His characterization is *so* exaggerated that it goes *well* beyond mere stereotyping, and instead creates a queer icon that challenges and subverts traditional gender norms. 

</james>

<james {% include timecode %}>

Another aspect of the film that can be interpreted as a queer allegory is its underlying critique of conformity. The plot revolves around the alien's plan to destroy Earth because they view it as a threat to their own culture, and way of life. This can be seen as a commentary on the obsessive forces of conformity that queer individuals have often faced. The aliens' desire for uniformity and sameness can be read as a metaphor for the societal pressures to conform to heteronormative standards and expectations. And even the internal expectations of the queer community.

Finally the film's low budget campy style can be seen as a celebration of the marginal and the underground. In the context of queer culture, camp has often been used as a way to resist and subvert dominant cultural norms. The film's deliberately bad acting, special effects, and overall production value can be seen as a queer refusal to conform to traditional Hollywood standards. (Or maybe I'm reaching a bit with that one.)

This, of course, included homosexuality, which was widely seen as a mental illness or a moral failing. Gay people in the 1950s faced significant depression<sup class="add">[sic: oppression? repression?]</sup> from the dominant culture, as well as legal and social sanctions. Homosexuality was illegal in *every* state, and those who were caught engaging in same-sex activities could face imprisonment or institutionalization in mental hospitals. In this culture of fear and secrecy, gay people were forced to hide their true selves and lead double lives, whereas suspected *communist* agents *chose* to lead double lives.

Many gay men and women were also forced into marriages with the opposite sex in order to maintain appearances and avoid suspicion. These marriages were often unhappy and unfulfilling for both partners and they often ended in divorce or estrangement. This further reinforced the idea that homosexuality was a choice, and that gay people could *choose* to be straight if they wanted to.

Gays and lesbians were also subject to violence and discrimination. In many areas gay bars were the only places where they could meet and socialize. However, these spaces were often raided by police who would arrest patrons and subject them to violence and humiliation. These bars were actually raided *more often* than suspected communist hideouts. Gays and lesbians were considered easier targets by the police, and since the government believed a queer person could easily be *turned* communist, arresting them was killing two birds with one stone. The policing of gender norms and the emphasis on conformity made it nearly impossible for gays and lesbians to be themselves and live fulfilling lives.

It wasn't until the Stonewall riots of 1969 and the subsequent gay rights movement that things began to change in America. But Hollywood *would* begin to ease up on the depiction of gay people in the 1960s. But mostly in coded ways.
