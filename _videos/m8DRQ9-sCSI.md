<span visual=none on="?" off="?">The queer community has become incredibly good at finding queer subtext in movies and TV shows, whether it exists or not.</span> 

<span visual={{tcc}} on="0:50" off="0:54">For over a century of film and television, we've probably been the most</span>  
<span visual={{tcc}} on="1:06" off="1:17">underrepresented minority in media. It was never illegal for a character of color to exist in a movie, but it *was* illegal, for a long time, for a queer character to exist.</span> Writers, directors, and producers could be taken to court under obscenity laws, fined and even jailed, for having the nerve to show a queer character. 

<span visual={{tcc}} on="1:36" off="1:40">At the same time, it's become a culturally agreed upon fact among</span>  
<span visual={{tcc}} on="10:22" off="10:37">cis-straight people, to the point of parody, that the queer community runs Hollywood. The Velvet or Pink Mafia, supposedly now run by David Geffin, is even an assumed queer media cartel that inserts LGBT messaging into movies and TV shows to corrupt the youth of America.</span>

The funny thing is, this isn't entirely false. I mean, we're not trying to corrupt the youth of America; growing up alone in the suburbs is doing a fine job of that all on its own.

<span visual={{tcc}} on="2:23" off="2:40">But there has always been a loose collective of queer creators that *do* insert coding into a lot of movies, TV shows, and books, coding that would likely be ignored by straight audiences but immediately recognized by those of us who are on the lookout.</span> <span visual="starwars">It's reached a bit of a fever pitch lately, with Poe and Finn,</span> <span visual="cap">Steve and Bucky,</span> <span visual="teenwolf">*Teen Wolf*,</span> <span visual="kora">*The Legend of Kora*,</span> <span visual="frozen">and even *Frozen*. But just because people outside queer spaces are finally recognizing it doesn't mean it's a new thing.</span> <span visual={{tcc}} on="4:59" off="5:04">What we now call queer baiting has been around since the early days of cinema. Sort of.</span> Film historians have given the early days of this phenomenon the name "queer coding", which a lot of people confuse with "queer baiting", but there is a big difference between the two.

<james {% include timecode %}>

"Queer coding" is when you're unable to show actual queer characters on screen, either because of the laws or morals of the day, or because studio executives just won't let you. So you create characters that the right audience will *obviously* view as gay, lesbian, bi, or transgender, to allow for LGBT representation when the entire world is telling you not to. A little golden nugget hidden deep underground for the people who are willing to dig for it. 

<span visual="teenwolf">While "queer baiting" is when you *do* have the ability to add queer characters to your film or TV show, but just don't want to risk turning off certain audiences or advertisers by doing so.</span> <span visual={{tcc}} on="3:10" off="3:15">One is an effort to give LGBT audiences at least a taste of representation,</span> <span visual="teenwolf">while the other is used to reel in said audience with an implied promise of queer characters without ever actually</span> <span visual="cap">intending on fulfilling that promise.</span>

It's like the cinematic equivalent of edging without the money shot.

Throughout this section, James uses the same footage and same examples that *The Celluloid Closet* does, in the same order, but crops the video in close to remove the titles showing what movie it is, or cuts around when the titles appear, and makes the edits faster.

<span visual={{tcc}} on="13:43" off="13:46">Along with homosexuality, sex,</span> <span visual={{tcc}} on="13:57" off="14:06">violence, and orgies were pretty common in early Hollywood, oddly in biblical films. And some people we're getting fed up with it.</span>

Starting in 1922, after the earliest of these morally questionable films had become massive successes, and a series of real life Hollywood scandals had rocked the papers, <mark num=1>studio heads enlisted <span visual={{tcc}} on="14:43" off="14:43">William H. Hayes, the former Postmaster General</span></mark> (so he was obviously qualified) to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. He was one of the few <mark num=2>unindighted members of Warren G. Harding's administration</mark> at the time, so obviously his moral fortitude was robust.

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.celluloid_closet at="(14:17)" %}>

Gore Vidal (Screenwriter): "The big change occurred when the movie moguls got together. Let's save Hollywood. We must get an outsider, preferably some politician who was above suspicion. So they looked into <mark num=2>the cabinet of Warren G. Harding. At that time there were a number of unindicted members of his cabinet</mark>. And <mark num=1>they picked the post-master general, Will Hays</mark> of Indiana. Who looked not unlike Mickey Mouse."

<u>[Will Hays appears on screen, heralded by grim music foreshadowing the terror to come.]</u>

Hays: "The code sets up high standards of performance for motion picture producers."

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<span visual={{tcc}} on="14:58" off="15:06">In 1924, he introduced a set of recommendations dubbed "The Formula", which Studios were advised to strictly follow. Back in 1915, the Supreme Court case *Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio* had already decided that Free Speech laws didn't extend to Motion Pictures, stating that</span> "because film may be used for evil, we cannot regard censorship as beyond the power of the government". So the industry was on thin ice as it was. It could be a *disaster* for them to draw the ire of conservatives in government. Directors and writers, though, mostly ignored the suggestions.

</james>
<from></from>
</compare>

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

In 1927, Hayes strongly suggested Studios form a committee to discuss film censorship. The heads of MGM and Fox complied and created a list of "don't"s and "be careful"s. This oddball list included things like:

<u>[Displayed on screen, read out word for word]:</u>

> Pointed profanity -- by either title or lip -- this includes the words "God", "Lord", "Jesus", "Christ" (unless they be used reverently in connection with the proper religious ceremonies), "hell", "damn", "Gawd" and every other profane and vulgar expression however it may be spelled;

> Any licentious or suggestive nudity -- in fact or in silhouette, and any lecherous or licentious notice thereof by other characters in the picture;

> The illegal traffic of drugs;

> Any inference of sex perversion;

> White slavery 

(but not black slavery, that was fine!)

> Miscegenation [or] (sexual relationship between the races);

> Sex Hygiene and Venial Diseases

> Scenes of actual childbirth -- in fact or in silhouette; as long as it isn't shown on screen

> Children's sex organs

(okay this one actually, you know, makes sense)

> Ridicule of the clergy;

> willful offense to any nation, race or creed;

(I feel like not *all* races were included in that)

> Special care should also be taken when portraying the use of firearms, the American flag, men and women sharing a bed, and actual murder[s].

So it was relatively okay to show *actual murder*, but even *the idea*, *the inference*, of homosexuality was a big no-no.

Many writers and directors in Hollywood, many of them gay themselves were, not too happy with the implementation of the Hays Code. Especially since in places like Weimar Republic Germany, advancement of queer representation on film was becoming mainstream. (At least until the rise of Adolf Hitler.) They saw what little progress that was taking place in North American Cinema come to a screeching halt with the Hays Code introduction, and they decided to fight back against it any way they could. And the only way they could at the time was to create characters that were quite obviously gay to any queer person watching, but who could fly under the radar of the censors.

As brave as the filmmakers were to show a pretty blatant example of a gay, or at least questioningly gay, relationship on screen, they knew the strict morals of the day might take the picture down. So Plato, the more obviously gay of the two characters, has to die in the end. He can't live happily ever after. He can't live at all. Can't give the impression that that kind of lifestyle could result in anything but pain and death. James Dean would die in a car accident before the film was even released. And... Sal Mineo would be stabbed to death in West Hollywood at the age of 37. <wbr off />

Armistead Maupin (Writer): "Rock had a screening room in his house, and he liked to assemble his house guests and show his old movies. Most of the guys I knew really liked to see the old Doris Day films. And I think one of the reasons we laughed at them so hard, was that there was a real gay in-joke occurring in almost all of those light comedies.

But it wasn't all roses. TV networks faced advertiser boycotts and people picketed movie theater showing *Brokeback Mountain*. There was money to be made by appealing to the LGBT community, but it came with great risk. That risk was compounded by a string of queer inclusive bombs like *Running With Scissors*, under-performers like *Milk*, and gay backlash toward movies like *Bruno* and *I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry*. 

The queer audience was a volatile one. One that wouldn't accept just any movie you gave them. And if you directly appealed to the queer audience, you ran the real risk of turning off the straights. So producers and writers needed to figure out a way to appeal to the gays without putting off the heteros. And they looked to a burgeoning internet fan community to find the answers.

## Part Two: Taking the Bait

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Now here's where I lay out a little caveat for you. In doing my research for this, I found enough instances of gay baiting to fill a whole book, let alone a video. So I decided to break it down into eight instances that stood out amongst the rest. These got the most media attention and the most fanfiction and the most fan attention. 

I'm also not going to be covering any queer baiting that was eventually made canonical, like with *The Legend Of Korra* and *Adventure Time*. That's actually called "queer catching", which is when a character's queerness is confirmed *after* a media franchise has finished and therefore you're not running the possibility of impacting its ratings or its sales. Or you reveal that a character is gay on a press tour for a movie but it's never really manifests in the movie itself. 

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

The most infamous example of this would be a certain British author confirming that Dumbledore was gay after her book series had ended. But she doubled down by *actually* queerbaiting him in a future film installment. But we're not done talking about her and her Wizards. Oh no. Not yet.

An interesting trend in queer baiting is that slightly more loose rules apply to lesbian characters. When two female characters are queer they may actually end up coupling up in the end of the story. This is of course because according to market research (and I work in marketing so I know this), male and female audiences are both more okay with lesbian characters than gay characters. While straight male audiences are likely to turn off immediately when two male characters turn out to be gay. It's even shown that parents are more likely to be okay with their kids seeing a lesbian couple than a gay couple. The assumption, at least among media researchers, is that it's easy for heteronormative audiences to view lesbian couples asexually, since there's technically no penetrative sex. Unless you *actually* know a lesbian and know that sex toys exist.

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But even then, lesbian characters are only likely to be confirmed to be queer at the end of the story if not afterwards in some other form of media, uh novels, comic books, stuff like that. Again, this happened with *The Legend Of Korra*, notoriously. It also *almost* happened very recently with the new incarnation of *She-Ra*, but they got that lesbian confirmation in *right* under the wire. And of course, that research doesn't cover everyone and there are plenty of people who find lesbians just as disgusting as gay men. 

The acceptance of lesbians in mainstream culture is just slightly more prevalent, mostly thanks to Ellen's brand of family safe gayness. *But* if anyone of you wants to share some videos or articles that cover lesbian queer baiting that I might have missed, please share them with me and I will link them in the description below. 

And I just want everyone to know... I tried to include *Supernatural*, I did, but try as I might I could not follow that show at all, it makes no sense!

So now that the caveats are out of the way...

<span visual>Merlin premiered on the BBC in September of 2008 and almost immediately became fodder for gay fan fiction.

<span visual={{atg}} james="36:22" on="1:55" off="2:15">Merlin is set in ancient Albion, a mythical version of England, in a time prior to the Arthurian legends (mostly prior to the Arthurian legends). <mark>Merlin has become the apprentice of Gaius the king's potions master.</mark> Merlin, in case you didn't know, also <mark>has the ability to use magic</mark>, but he needs to keep it secret from everyone.

For those of you who don't know: Merlin is set in arthurian legend, A time when king Arthur ruled over Albion. Which is a nerdy way of saying England. There's a lot of stories about king Arthur like: The round table, the holy grail and Monty Python!

<mark>Throughout the series it's pretty obvious that magic is a metaphor for being LGBT+</mark>. From just the overall exclusion to the death penalty. It gets in your face at times.

"What if... magic isn't something you choose?"

"Until then ... we go unmarked in death as in life." 

<mark>It's not even "I practice magic" it's "I have magic".</mark> Merlin has to deal with that shame while at the same time using magic to save Arthur's life and never getting recognition. He speaks out about his frustrations;

<span visual={{atg}} on="20:48" off="21:05">Magic is Merlin's greatest weapon, though, and he uses it to save Arthur's life time and time again throughout the series. Merlin is so close to Arthur, so drawn to him, despite the servant-master divide between them, that he's willing to risk his *life*, not just to save Arthur's life but to even be *around* him.</span>

<span visual={{atg}} on="24:18" off="24:33">If he were to accidentally use magic in front of the wrong person, it would be the end of him. He even hides his magic from Arthur because he fears Arthur would hate him if he found out, a feeling all too familiar to queer kids developing crushes on their... presumed straight friends.</span>

<span visual={{ytc1}} on="2:09" off="2:35">As the series progresses, the dynamic between the two becomes even clearer. Arthur seems to prefer the company of Merlin to most *anyone* else.

If you don't know, Gwen is this other servant girl who works in Camelot and is the son<sup class="add">[sic: daughter]</sup> of a blacksmith, is also a badass and is local friend to Merlin and Arthur and she's great. And although that may seem like a bad thing for a love-struck Merlin, <mark>it helps him believe that maybe Arthur can learn to love a servant</mark>. His relationship with Gwen gives him hope. Hope that Arthur can look beyond class and love somebody for who they are.

Hell, <mark>when the waiter approaches Sherlock, he assumes John is his date!</mark>

</james>
<from span="4" {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.aretheygay_sherlock at="(4:12)" %}>

Let's also think about the beginning of the restaurant scene. <mark>When Angelo first brought John and Sherlock their food, he assumes that John is his date.</mark>

> Waiter: "Sherlock. Anything on the menu, whatever you want: free. On the house for you, and for your date." 
> 
> Sherlock: "Do you want to eat?" 
> 
> Watson: "I'm not his date." 

And Sherlock brushes it off and doesn't even comment about it. But why would Angelo assume John is Sherlock's date? Surely Angelo and Sherlock have a long history together since Angelo and Sherlock are both very friendly to each other. So, after all these years Angelo made the conclusion that Sherlock is attracted to men? <mark num=2>And Sherlock doesn't even deny it</mark>, he just went with the flow. 

Who else has known Sherlock for a long time? His landlady, Mrs. Hudson. And she assumed that Sherlock and John were a couple too:

> Watson: "I've met someone."
> 
> Landlady: (squeal, claps hands) "Oh, lovely!"
> 
> Watson: "Yeah, we're getting married. Well, I'm gonna ask anyway."
> 
> Landlady: "So soon after Sherlock?"
> 
> Watson: "Hm, well yes."
> 
> Landlady: (smile falters for a few seconds) "What's his name?"
> 
> Watson: (sighs) "It's a woman."
> 
> Landlady: "A woman?!"
> 
> Watson: "Yes, of course, it's a woman!"
> 
> Landlady: (laughs) "You really have moved on, haven't you?"

> Watson: "Mrs. Hudson! How many times? Sherlock was NOT my boyfriend."

So one must presume that Sherlock has brought men here before. <mark num=2>And Sherlock isn't the one to deny it.</mark> John is. Emphatically.

Same for Scorpius: he doesn't live up to his father's expectations either. He's a bit weird, kind of a goofball, which doesn't fly with the Malfoy family.

<mark>As this play goes on, it follows Albus and Scorpius's lives over the next few years. Mainly focusing on Albus</mark> because, you know son of... main character.

We start to explore Albus's past, his relationship with his father, Harry, and the tension there. Albus has a lot to live up to under his father's name, And <mark>he feels like a black sheep in the Potter family</mark> at every turn. He's <mark>sorted into *Slytherin*</mark> while his family are notoriously from the Gryffindor house, He and his friends are outcasts, 

Both Scorpius and Albus don't live up to other people's expectations. <mark>but they still have each other.</mark> And despite the other relationships that are built in this story, Albus and Scorpius's story is the heart of the play. Their need for each other is emphasized throughout the story.

<mark>Harry *tried* to make Albus feel welcome</mark>, but he just doesn't understand his son. It's an easy allegory for parents of queer kids trying to be accepting, but they're just can't get it right. <mark>Scorpius is the only person that Albus feels comfortable with.</mark>

So going back to Albus's narrative <mark>Harry tries to reconcile things with a son</mark>, but there's a disconnect. Albus still feels like an outsider like he's not enough for his dad. <mark>The only person he's comfortable with is... Scorpius.</mark>

At the start of their fourth year, they share a moment of intimacy, one that Albus doesn't really show with other people.

That is a unique thing between them. Albus is desperate for someone to care for, and when he believed that no one else could give him love. He turns in desperation to Scorpius. He hugs him.

It's that disconnect of communication, of intimacy Albus and Scorpius are not used to being close with other people besides each other, and for Scorpius to reveal and expose himself to Albus is... something big for him.

Albus begins explaining why he was avoiding Scorpius and how Harry thinks Scorpius is <mark>Voldemort's son</mark>. And then the hidden love confession starts. Scorpius has just exposed the angry part of himself but now Albus is exposing how he really feels, too. <u>[another sax solo]</u>

So, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has said there will never be a *Cursed Child* movie. (Which Warner Brothers might disagree with considering how well this play is doing.) But, I think she's right. Because no one will be able to watch this movie and not see these two boys as gay, no matter *how many* no-homo endings, you tag<sup class="add">[sic: tack]</sup> on. Honestly, Harry-Draco helped kind of helped create modern gay fan fiction, and then Albus and Scorpius were *this close* to making a version of it canon. *This close.* 

I am thoroughly convinced that at some point in the writing process, the playwrights *did* intend on them being gay. And it got switched somewhere along the line. It's not unheard of, it's not the first time that's happened.

For some viewers, Lou's overall look suggests that the character could be queer, and even that her close friendship with Debbie was perhaps born from a romantic entanglement in their past. When asked if this was intentional, Edwards laughed.

"<mark>You know, <span stat:id="changed-quote"></span> early on, there was an idea that</mark> that <mark>might be the case</mark>," she said. "<mark>But we seemed to move away from that as the shooting went on.</mark>"

<from span=3 {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.aretheygay_sterek at="(1:56)" %}>

Now, it is the relationship between Stiles and Derek that we're here to talk about, and cherry-picked evidence that preconclude assumptions about. (kidding but kind of not.)

<mark>Over the course of the seasons</mark> they go from sort of hating each other to... Loving each other? <u>[first few notes of George Michael's "Careless Whisper" playing]</u>

It may be my <u>[echoing]</u> HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA talking, but I think there might be something real here. Let's try to examine it with an... open mind.

<h3>1. Stiles is 100% bi</h3>

To the untrained eye Stiles may seem like a straight dude.

> <mark></mark>Stiles: "I-... Well, dad. There's a conversation that we-"
>
> Dad: "You're not gay."
>
> Stiles: (balks) "Well I could be!"

He loves the ladies! Of course he does.

> <mark num=2></mark>Girl: "I do like girls. Do you?"
>
> Stiles: "Absolutely."

But as me and the entire queer community has acknowledged, liking girls doesn't mean you can't like other genders.

> <mark num=2></mark>Stiles: "Do you also like boys?"
>
> Girl: "Absolutely! Do you?"
>
> Music in background: "*I said I love you!*"

> Stiles: [Stares off into the distance] *sudden realisation*

<u>[Garage]</u>

<mark></mark>Stiles: "Well, Dad, there's a conversation that we--"

Dad: "You're not gay."

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So pretty quickly, it set up that Stiles is bisexual. Is it said outright? *No!* Of course <wbr on />not! That would be too easy.<wbr off /> But is it made painfully obvious?

</james>
<from span=7 {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.aretheygay_sterek at="(1:56)" %}>

And this isn't just a one-time thing. Stiles' Potential Gayness is hinted at throughout the show. One of the first is when he wonders about how attractive he is the gay guys, which is usually a thing only people who *want* gay guys attention worry about.

> <u>[Walking down school hallway]</u>
> 
> Stiles: "I don't think Danny likes me very much."
> 
> Scott: "I asked Alison on a date and now we're hanging out."
> 
> Stiles: "Am I not attractive to gay guys?"
> 
> Scott: "I make first lineup and the team captain wants to destroy me, and now... I'm going to be late for work."
> 
> Stiles: "Wait, Scott! You didn't--! Am I attractive to gay guy--!? You didn't answer my question."

Now, this may be a vanity thing or an overly self-aware type of humor, but it's still only funny in a world where gay is seen as funny. And if this world -as the creator has stated- is truly a world without homophobia, then why do these lines exist? It's not just the homoerotic dialogue, but Stiles' attraction to men actually manifests in certain forms.

> Stiles (to Scott): "Everyone wants you. You know, you're like the hot girl that every guy wants."

> <u>[Stiles shouting out a car window]</u>

> Stiles: "Hey, come on, Jackson, you're way too pretty to be out here all by yourself."

> Man: "We should, maybe, take this upstairs?"

> 
> Scott: "Shut up."
> 
> Stiles: "No, but seriously. You wanna try to make out for a second?" (Scott pushes him) "Just to see how it feels!"

There's even a point where <mark>Stiles and Scott go to a gay bar and a guy ordered a drink for Scott and not Stiles, and Stiles gets jealous!</mark>

And this is not an accident. Even the action is pointing toward romance, whether it's obvious or not. <mark visual=none on="?" off="?">Take this scene, where they're both paralyzed (a-again).

In my mind, if you can create a world like that on TV, maybe life starts to imitate it."

<span visual=none on="?" off="?"><mark>There are plenty of out queer characters on Teen Wolf</mark>, <mark>but none of them are leads.</mark> The Sterek fandom became rabid online with art and fan fiction, becoming just as popular as the show itself.

The reason this is so onerous is because the queer baiting didn't even stay in the show! They moved it over into real life. Stiles wasn't just coded adorably bisexual, they used *queer baiting* to get you to *do something* for them!

Danny even just sort of disappeared!

There is some representation, which I am really grateful for, but the problem is that there seems to be a lot of bait. For Pete's sake they literally queer baited Danny. And also- What about all those queerish moments between Stiles and Derek that were probably put in for fanservice? The actors and creators are sometimes receptive to Sterek in a good way..? But only in ways that attract open-minded and queer viewers, and then kick them to the curb.

Arguably, the three biggest media franchises in the world right now are Star Wars, Frozen, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They all have a few things in common: they're all owned by Disney and they've all been accused of queer baiting. Disney is actually kind of terrible for this. Not only do they queerbait their characters, they actually create queer media... and then *yank it away* from you! 

*Love, Victor* was a sequel TV series to the hit film *Love, Simon*. It was announced alongside Disney Plus as one of the big reasons to buy into the service. But then when the show actually *had gay content*, Disney shafted it over to Hulu. Which is not available in nearly as many places as Disney Plus, essentially segregating a gay show that they had promised their viewers. Putting it on a service with a fraction of the subscribers. That way when the ratings aren't that great, they can just say it wasn't popular, and let it die. Maybe even use it as an example as to why queer content doesn't sell! Like I said in my [Stonewall Film Effect video](4YWslnyUxcs.md), as far as executives are concerned, a queer movie or show or book that fails *always* fails because it's queer, never because of the circumstances around it.

Okay. Rant over. Frozen!

## Frozen
{% assign timecode = "1:10:57" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

There's not a whole lot to show about Frozen because most of the queer coding is in song. And Disney will come down on me with the Intellectual Property Hammer<sup>TM</sup> if I play a song from Frozen. But the first film was read as *super queer* by a sizable portion of the population. So much so that homophobic bloggers accused Disney of "indoctrinating children" with the gay agenda. (But they wouldn't have anything to *write* about if children *weren't* being indoctrinated in the gay agenda, so let's ignore them!)

But actual LGBTQ fans of the film latched on to Elsa being the first potentially queer Disney princess, creating the Evergreen social media trend #GiveElsaAGirlfriend. "Let It Go" became a sort of a gay anthem, and the film featured queer icon Idina Menzel in the lead and gay heart throb and (my future husband) Jonathan Groff voicing Kristoff. So fans were hoping for *a lot* when *Frozen 2* finally hit theaters this past year. While the film didn't state Elsa's sexuality one way or another, it left the door *open*, *hinting* at a gay relationship between her and Honeymaren. And the new song "Show Yourself", while not a cultural phenomenon like "Let It Go", became a gay anthem. I mean, with these lyrics how could it not?

So though it wasn't obvious, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega were certainly playing it that way. So would it be more obvious in *The Last Jedi*? Well, leading up to the release of *The Last Jedi*, *Star Wars* producer Kathleen Kennedy was asked about the potential relationship. She said:

<u>[Quote scrolling on screen like a Star Wars opening text crawl]:</u>

So not *The Last Jedi*, okay. Running out of time here guys. How about *Rise Of Skywalker*?

I remember, uh, it was an audition and the two of us just like did that first scene back-to-back, butt-to-butt, you know, just like doing the scene together practicing it in this room, and like it was just like immediately, all you know all kind of artifice, everything just collapsed, and there was like an intimacy that was very just like there. And um and I think the fact that neither of us shied away from that while we were shooting as well... I think it just was like these are two guys that you know are... he's happy being intimate with each other emotionally, and that um...

Oscar: "So it wasn't actually a total shock that, you know, you know, people, you know, wanted to, you know-- s-saw that in there. Personally, I-I kind of hoped and wished that maybe that would have been taken further uh, in the other films but... you know I don't have control over that..."

So he wasn't happy about it. The fans shipping FinnPoe weren't happy about it. The gay community wasn't happy about it. And the *Rise Of Skywalker* became the lowest grossing film of the new trilogy. *Star Wars* is now in brand-rehab at Disney, who are trying to figure out what to do with the property after it seemed like no one could agree on *any* of their five *Star Wars* movies that they made to date! With *Solo* bombing at the box office, and *Rise Of Skywalker* coming *nail-bitingly* close to losing money.

I'm not saying making Poe and Finn gay would have saved the box office, probably the opposite, to be honest. But at least Disney could have said that they did something before any other studio. <span class="visual">That they put gay characters in a giant cinematic spectacle before most studios are willing to even *give us a movie at all*.</span> But this is the company that tossed *Love, Victor* back into the streaming closet, so what else would we expect? 

I mean, I'm sure Disney hasn't done anything like this before. <u>[Turning as if someone's speaking to him from off-screen]</u> What was that?

## Captain America
{% assign timecode = "1:17:49" %}

<james {% include timecode %}>

Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, (AKA Chris Evans, because he's the real superhero), and Bucky Burns, AKA The Winter Soldier, are two of the many many many characters in the Disney-owned Marvel Cinematic Universe. They were originally created *way back* in the 1940s, when Bucky was actually Steve's kid sidekick. Because every superhero had to have a kid sidekick.

Fast forward seventy years and about a hundred iterations later, and we see the pairing that become known *the world over* as "Stucky". <span visual=none on="?" off="?">Right from the off, there's a sort of chemistry between them, with Bucky kind of acting as a big brother figure to Steve, who needs help fighting the bullies in his life. Steve's got a big heart, but that's about the only part of him that's big.</span> (Wait, does the Super Soldier serum make your--?)

</james>
<from></from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

<span visual=none on="?" off="?">One of the things I noticed the first time I saw the movie, which was the first MCU movie I saw, by the way, was that Steve *seemed way* more interested in joining the Army than being with girls. It's easy to read this as him just being *so darn patriotic*, but it was actually extremely common for gay men in the first half of the 20th century to join the military. An all male environment seemed pretty appealing to a lot of gay men at the time. Even if you *did* run the risk of getting shot by a Nazi. But at least you'd die a *hero* instead of people back home finding out that you're a queer, and dying ashamed and alone.</span>

</james>
<from></from>
<james span=2 {% include timecode %}>

There's also a hint of gay shame. Steve feels like he's not good enough, <span visual=none on="?" off="?">not a real man, and he wants *so badly* to be like everyone else that he's willing to go through a very risky procedure to make it happen. Was this gay coding in the 1940s? Of course not! It was just a superhero origin story. It may not be allegorical, but it's certainly applicable. Which is something that makes superheroes so timeless: no matter who you are no matter where or when you live, you can project yourself onto a superhero.</span>

But I'm not here to say that Captain America and Bucky Barnes are gay. ...I'm here to say that the *MCU's* Captain America and Bucky Barnes are gay. <span visual=none on="?" off="?">Now, of course, Steve is madly in love with Peggy Carter, but look at the woman: she's smart, she's gorgeous, she's a badass, how could you not *help* but fawn over her? She's not just any woman, she's one hell of an *exceptional* woman.</span> And also the obligatory love interest, but she's awesome, so we'll ignore that.

Peggy: "You must have danced."

Steve: "Well, asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying. In the past few years, just didn't seem to matter that much. Figured I'd wait."

Peggy: "For what?"

Steve: "Right partner."

(Peggy smiles)

Interesting use of the word "partner", there. Could have said "the right girl". 

<wbr on />So, after Steve becomes Captain America, Bucky is captured and presumed killed by Hydra, the super Nazis, and Steve goes out to save him. Bucky means the world to him, and if there's even a *chance* of him being alive, he's not going to lose him. Cap saves the day, of course, and this tiny gesture...<wbr off /> 

<u>[Showed clip of Cap putting a hand on the back of Bucky's neck for a second.]</u>

I don't know, it really caught my attention the first time I saw the movie.

<wbr on />As they're escaping, the facility begin begins to melt down, but Bucky refuses to leave without Steve. Eventually they both escape, and the dynamic between them changes. Steve is no longer the little guy looking up to his bud Bucky. Bucky is now admiring Steve. Becoming his partner. Fighting the Nazis with him. Until... Bucky falls from a train into a frozen European Wasteland below.

This breaks Steve. The All-American man of men superhero breaks down into tears the loss of Bucky. He's seen so much death in this war, so much carnage, so much loss, but it's the loss of Bucky that breaks him. Then Steve decides to *die* rather than be with Peggy, and crashes a Nazi super plane into a glacier, where he's found a few decades later and resurrected. Because superheroes.

Then in *Winter Soldier*, we find out that Bucky isn't dead. He's been kept alive by Hydra all this time, and is an assassin for them. Again, because superheroes. So while Steve is slowly acclimating to living in the 21st century, the return of Bucky shakes him to his core. A part of his life he thought he'd lost forever is back. 

Steve's already seen Peggy, but she's not the Peggy he knew. She's aged, dying. He still cares for her, of course, but Bucky's the same age as Steve, give or take. He's like a memory, plucked from the past and placed smack dab in Steve's present. Like Steve, he's a part of a world that no longer exists. So even though Bucky has been brainwashed and has the blood of *hundreds* of murdered people on his hands, Steve cannot bring himself to kill him. Not his Bucky. Not in this world of a new millennium, where being LGBT isn't so frowned upon, and maybe he and Bucky could be a real thing.<wbr off /> Peggy even kind of gives Steve permission.

Peggy: "The world has changed. None of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over." (coughing fit)

</clip>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And Bucky's the only person in this whole wide crazy world that Steve feels he can really connect with. <wbr on />Though Bucky doesn't remember Steve and everyone around him tells him Bucky *needs* to be taken down, Steve refuses. He hopes beyond hope that he can bring Bucky back, not just to save Bucky but to save himself. To be not so alone.

After fighting in a doomed helicarrier, Steve backs off, takes off his helmet, and bears his soul to Bucky, literally dropping his shield, something he hasn't done before. Something that's only *worth it* because it's for Bucky. He does this again in Civil War, literally and metaphorically letting his guard down. For one person, and one person only. When Bucky holds Steve's life in his hand, about to land the killing blow, Steve tells him to do it:

</james>
<from></from>
<clip {% include citation for=page.cite.clips.winter_soldier %}>

Steve: "Then finish it. 'Cuz I'm with you to the end of the line."

<james {% include timecode %}>

Steve trusts Bucky, even now in this demented state. He trusts him with his life. And we can see in Bucky's eyes, he's remembering. He's remembering his friend. Looking down into his face, he sees someone he loves. He can't kill him. And when Steve falls from the helicarrier with Bucky left alive, he could just let him fall and drown in the water below. But he saves him. Just like Steve saved him back in World War II. So even after being reprogrammed a hundred times by Hydra, the memory of his love for Steve is so strong,<wbr off /> platonic or romantic, it doesn't matter, their bond is so strong that he overrides *all* of that programming, and saves the most important person in the world to him.

<wbr on />Bucky disappears in into the ether after that, but Steve knows he's alive out there, and he won't give up looking for him. A mission that culminates in *Captain America: Civil War*. In *Civil War*, Steve is willing to let the Avengers fall apart to save Bucky. He's willing to let the might of the *whole world* come down on his shoulders to save Bucky, even after it's revealed that Bucky killed Tony's parents, he still won't let him go, and by abandoning his shield he's even willing to leave the identity of Captain America behind. Because he doesn't need to be Captain America anymore, he doesn't need to be an Avenger, because he's got Bucky.

So Steve and Bucky love each other. Even Joe Russo, the director of *Civil War*, said so! Calling the movie a love story between the two heroes. 

Now you can say, "James, they're just good friends." <mark>These arguments often start out under the guise of progressive thought, making claims like "there's so few examples of non-toxic masculinity in media, so we need more portrayals of a positive friendship between two men." This sounds like a good argument at first, until you think about it for a minute or two and remember that *almost all* media is about male relationships and male friendships.</mark>

<mark>When it comes to Captain America, and Bucky Barnes specifically, that well has been tapped quite thoroughly. The relationship between two men who fought alongside each other in a war has been the topic of *many* stories throughout millennia. It's one of the most popular male friendship stories ever. And why shouldn't that relationship go beyond just a friendship? Does it ruin the value of the friendship if it's also non-platonic? *The Iliad*'s story of Achilles and Patroclus' relationship should serve as an early counterpoint here.

<mark>Ideally, people in a relationship with one another would also be friends. If the idea of characters being in a relationship *ruins* that for you, then perhaps you should think about why you feel that way.</mark>

And flip the coin for a second, say Bucky's a woman. Watching these movies, seeing this relationship, would you think for even a second that these two people *aren't* going to end up together in the end? Really? But of course, they don't, because fucking Disney. 

And oddly enough the Stucky pairing would probably be the most Disney friendly gay relationship they could have. Because fans of the proposed couple aren't fans because of the expected sex. (Sure, there's plenty of porn online of the two of them, if you're willing to go look for it.) But that's not what draws people to them. It's a bond between them. It's a bond that lasts for decades, travels through time, goes through hell and back, and yet in the end, they're still dedicated to each other. It's a love story.

I don't even think it was done on purpose, to be honest. Unlike *Teen Wolf* and *Sherlock*, I don't think the writers wrote this pairing or the actors played these parts with the intent on baiting gays into <wbr on />loving them. We were going to go see Chris Evans anyway it's just kind of happened.<wbr off /> A natural outgrowth of the chemistry between the two actors, playing two characters that are innately drawn to one another. I think it's a beautiful accident that can be read as either platonic or romantic love. The fact that so many gay people read it as being a queer love story just shows how starved we are for representation in movies. Just like in the days of queer coding, we're willing to dig deep into our favorite media to find any hint of us possibly being represented. Whether those golden nuggets are actually there or not. But we keep looking and looking, someday, hopefully very soon, there will be a gold rush. Even if right now we're only finding fool's gold.

This video has been a long time coming. I originally started working on it about a year ago, and it was called "For the Love of Stucky" and was just a look at the Stucky relationship. To say it's grown a bit as a bit of an understatement. uh, I'm hoping to get another video out, oh, maybe *sooner* than a year from now? Uh, you can check out my patreon if you'd like to help out in the production of these videos, or... just like, share, and subscribe. Nothing gets this channel out there more than that. You can also follow me on Twitter, @je_summerton, or check out my Community page to vote on what video I'll be doing next. So, thank you, *so much* for watching. I hope you enjoyed this beast of a video. uh, I will be back soon with more content, I promise. So until then take care stay safe.
