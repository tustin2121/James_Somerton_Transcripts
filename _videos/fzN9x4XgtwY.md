*The Boys in the Band* is a 1970 American film directed by William Friedkin of *Exorcist* fame, based on the 1968 Off-Broadway play of the same name by Mark Crowley. The film takes place in New York City in 1968, and follows a group of gay friends who gather for a birthday party. 

The main character is Michael, a neurotic and self-loathing gay man who is hosting the party for his... "friend" Harold, a flamboyant and witty gay man. As the night wears on, the guests become increasingly drunk and confrontational, leading to heated arguments and revelations about their personal lives. The arrival of a *straight* friend, Alan, adds to the tension as he is uncomfortable with the gay culture and the... open homosexuality on display.

As the night progresses, the character's relationships with each other become more complicated, leading to a climactic confrontation that exposes their vulnerabilities and insecurities. 

<mark>On the strength of a classy set of New York stage reviews, and its billing as a "comedy", despite its dead serious content, *The *Boys in the Band** was taken for *gospel* in an America populated by people who had never met a homosexual in their entire lives.</mark>

<mark>On the strength of a classy set of New York stage reviews and its billing as a comedy despite its dead serious intent, *The Boys in the Band* was taken for gospel in an America populated by people who had never met a live homosexual in their entire lives.</mark> The film presented a perfunctory compendium of easily acceptable stereotypes who gather at a Manhattan birthday party and spend an evening savaging each other and their way of life. The "landslide of truths" consisted ultimately of some jumbled Freudian stabs at overly protective mothers and absent fathers and lots of zippy fag humor that posed as philosophy. Yet in spite of itself, Crowley's passion play was part catharsis and part catalyst. His characters were losers or borderline survivors at best, but they paved the way for winners.

The possibility that there could be non-stereotypical homosexuals, who are *also* staunch advocates of a working gay relationship, is presented by the two lovers throughout the film.

Although it was difficult to see this clearly in 1970, The Boys in the Band presented some attractive and functional gay men who formed an implicit challenge to the stereotypes exploited in Emory (Cliff Gorman) and Harold (Leonard Frey). <mark>The film was not positive, but it was fair. The heterosexual Alan (Peter White) can easily despise the nellie Emory because he is everything a faggot is supposed to be, a "butterfly in heat."

<mark>The speech encapsulated self-hatred and reflected a generation of gay men who were indoctrinated to blame their problems all on their homosexuality. In the end Michael's self-hatred and inability to function became as archaic as Harold's habit of putting his weed in a Band-Aid box in the medicine chest so that he could flush it down the toilet in case the cops arrived. Michael's weeping fits and old movie visions shone light, not on his homosexuality, but on the fallacies and illusions of Hollywood dreams. Dreams that had taught gay men that they were not welcome in polite society.</mark>

<mark>Hollywood was not moved to change a wit by all of this hysteria in gay drawing rooms in Manhattan though. Yet *Boys in the Band* moved gay men throughout the country. The internalized guilt and self-hatred of eight gay men at a Manhattan birthday party formed the best and most *potent* argument for gay liberation ever offered in popular media. It provided actual and personal instances of the detrimental repercussions of what gay men learn about themselves through media falsehoods. And the film sparked the first public pushback by a budding gay rights movement *against* Crowley's plays accepted prejudices.</mark>

When Clive Barnes called *The Boys in the Band* a homosexual play, he was right. It was a homosexual period piece just as *Green Pastures* was a Negro period piece. But blacks are visible and gays are not, and <mark>Hollywood was not moved to change a whit by all this hysteria in the gay drawing rooms of Manhattan. Yet *Boys* moved homosexuals throughout the country. The internalized guilt and self-hatred of eight gay men at a Manhattan birthday party formed the best and most potent argument for gay liberation ever offered in a popular art form. It supplied concrete and personalized examples of the negative effects of what homosexuals learn about themselves from the distortions of the media. And the film caused the first public reaction by a burgeoning gay rights movement to the accepted stereotypes in Crowley's play.</mark>

<mark>Gay protesters did not deny the existence of such stereotypes. but they were quick to point out that the viewpoint was one-sided and the prejudice is defined as the sole depiction or representation of any group of people by a minority stereotype. *The Boys in the Band* was a movie about gays... and a gay movie. It was a creation born of a subculture and reflected a *harsh* reflection. Society viewed it as if it were a scientific trip. But it was an interior journey for many gays who were shocked by the sadness of Michael's sickening rituals. Many of Crowley's caricatures were misconceptions that gays had accepted and even fit themselves into since there seemed to be no other option.</mark> 

<mark>The audience for *Boys in the Band* included gay people who had grown up thinking that they were the only gays in the world. The film explored passing and not being able to pass, loving and not being able to love, and above all else, surviving in a world that denied one's very existence. But it did so before an American public that was at the stage of... *barely* being able to *mention* homosexuality at all.</mark>

<mark>Protests by gays did not dispute the existence of such stereotypes, but they were quick to point out that the view was one-sided and that the exclusive depiction or representation of any group of people by a minority stereotype is called bigotry. *The Boys in the Band* was a play about homosexuals and a homosexual play. It was a work that sprang from the subculture itself and represented bitter reflection. Society treated it as though it were a scientific expedition, but in fact it was an inner journey for countless gays who snapped to attention when confronted with the pathos of Michael's sickening routines. Many of the stereotypes put forth by Crowley were myths that gays had accepted and even fit themselves into because there appeared to be no alternative.</mark> At the beginning of the 1960s, two British films about the life of Oscar Wilde could not even be shown in the United States because the Code had not yet been revised. <mark>The audience for *The Boys in the Band* included gay people who had grown up thinking that they were the only homosexuals in the world.

But it did so before an American public that was at the stage of barely being able to mention homosexuality at all.</mark> It was a gay movie for gay people, and it immediately became both a period piece and a reconfirmation of the stereotypes.

Within a few years of *Boys in the Band*, there was <mark>*Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams*, in which Joanne Woodward's son's homosexuality is solely perceived in terms of how it impacts her current midlife crisis, as yet another sign of her failure as a wife and mother. She eventually comes to terms with it, but her son leaves for Amsterdam with a friend and refuses to visit his parents until they can live with him as he truly is. He makes *their* reluctance to recognize him as a full person their problem. A family affair rather than his.</mark>

Only twice, both times incidentally, has a serious American film dealt with homosexuality as a family issue or even suggested that homosexuals might be someone's children. In Gilbert Cates' *Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams* and in Robert Mulligan's *Bloodbrothers*, the alienation of gay children from their parents provides vignettes that ring true but lack focus in their own contexts. <mark>In *Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams* (1973), the homosexuality of Joanne Woodward's son (Ron Rickards) is seen only in terms of how the revelation affects her present mid-life crisis, as one more token of her failure as a wife and mother. In the end, she comes to terms with it. Her son, who does not commit suicide or go insane, moves to Amsterdam with a lover and refuses to see his parents until they can deal with him as he is. He turns their inability to see him as a whole person into their problem, a family matter, not his problem.</mark>

James says "It was noted in the 1980s," as if everything before and after this isn't also from Vito Russo's book published in 1987. You could preface every sentence in this video with "It was noted in the 1980s" if you wanted. Then he bizarrely changes Russo's words in the "quote," presumably so that anyone looking it up won't be able to find where it's from and figure out what's happening here.

(These movies *never* seem to be about the sexuality of the people in them.) <mark>These people were a gay doctor, a straight career lady, and a bisexual artist with whom they were both in love. *Sunday Bloody Sunday* was *not* about sexuality as Schlesinger correctly said, however it was a film in which alternative sexuality was taken for granted. Something that gay activists had long sought. It was a film on human relationships, and how they do not always correspond to our expectations of what love should be.</mark>

<mark>"This film," Schlesinger said,</mark> <mark>"is not about the sexuality of these people."</mark> <mark>The people in question were a homosexual doctor (Peter Finch), a heterosexual career woman (Glenda Jackson) and the bisexual artist (Murray Head) with whom they were both in love. And Schlesinger was right; Sunday, Bloody Sunday was not about sexuality. But it was a film in which alternative sexuality was taken for granted, something that gay activists had been asking for all along. It was a film about human relationships and how they do not always match our ideas about what love ought to be.</mark> Everyone in the film settles for something less than he or she had hoped for or been taught to expect - except the bisexual, whose sexuality is viewed as part of his youthful noncommitment to anyone or anything but his work. When Head runs off to America at the end of the film, leaving Jackson and Finch to fend for themselves, it is clear that their lives will continue though they are trapped in resignation. In the end, they realize, one is always alone.

<mark>The film presented a happy ending for a homosexual character whose dull resignation is not the product of his gayness. Finch tells the audience in a closing monologue,</mark> <mark>"People say to me, He never made you happy. And I say, But I am happy. Apart from missing him. All my life I've been looking for someone courageous and resourceful. He's not it. But something. We were something."</mark> The speech has little to do with homosexuality, but it does say that gay relationships are not nothing. And Sunday, Bloody Sunday said some- thing even more universal and important, that "the whole thing" that Jackson's mother spoke of is an illusion. Like the cold, metallic connections made by the telephone equipment at the beginning of the film, people connect randomly, hoping that their system of relating will not break down before they can connect and find a way to make it work together.

<mark>America hated *Sunday, Bloody Sunday*. One kiss exchanged between Head and Finch caused even more of a stir than scenes that showed them in bed together. Male-male relationships are defined in terms of sex, yet in many minds affectionate love between men is out of the question. And this was the first affectionate kiss onscreen between two men that was not a device or a shock mechanism. It drew gasps from audiences wherever it played, and because of it many theaters would not book the film at all.</mark> The London press quoted singer Shirley Bassey, a friend of Peter Finch, as complaining that at a screening the kiss had made her sick to her stomach, forcing her to leave the theater. The flood of gay films that followed *The Boys in the Band* into release in 1970 revealed many similar instances of latent homophobia among actors, writers, directors and critics.

*<h4>Some General Principles for Motion Picture and Television Treatment of Homosexuality</h4>*

1. <mark>Homosexuality isn't funny.</mark> Sometimes anything can be a source of humor, but the lives of twenty million Americans are not a joke.
2. Fag, faggot, dyke, queer, lezzie, homo, fairy, mary, pansy, sissy, etc. are terms of abuse. If you don't want to insult, the words are gay, lesbian and homosexual. That doesn't mean that nobody on film can use a dirty word, but if you have rules about kike, wop, spic, nigger, etc., use them for fag and dyke.
3. <mark>Use the same rules you have for other minorities. If bigots don't get away with it if they hate Catholics, they can't get away with it if they hate gays.</mark> Put another way, the rights and dignity of homosexuals are not a controversial issue.
4. <mark>Stereotypical people do exist. But if such a minority of any group receives exclusive media exposure, that's bigotry.</mark> Until a broad spectrum of the gay community is expressed on film and the stereotypes are put into perspective, their use is damaging.
5. Homosexuality is a natural variant of human sexuality. It is not an illness, nor is it a problem for the majority of gays who are happy to be what they are. If all blacks or Jews or Irish or Chicanos were portrayed as anguished, oddball or insane, they'd be angry too. Gays are angry.
6. If you are doing a drama or a comedy or a talk show about homosexuality, you have an obligation to do your homework and free yourself from the myths.
7. There is a wide variety of available themes concerning the place of homosexuality in contemporary society and the range of gay relationships and lifestyles. Many of these can provide entertainment for a broad, general public. Gays do not want to return to media invisibility.
8. A permanent board of consultants consisting of gay men and women is available to the industry. But there are gay people all around you in your jobs. It is up to you to provide a climate in which they feel free to speak out openly.

Hmm... <mark>Television, which is subject to the regulation of the FCC *and* to the reaction of its advertisers to vocal public opinion, was more vulnerable to this type of activist pressure than was the motion picture industry. Television programming, which aired nearly 24 hours a day, was always in need of societal concerns to address. Homosexuality being one of them. A film must be a success, but if a television show fails, there is *always* next week and another subject to try. Therefore experimentation was encouraged. Pressure from gay liberation influenced television's approach to portraying homosexuality for the American audience.

The story was a trifle mild for gay liberationists; while it received rave reviews in the straight press, some gay writers condemned it for being too tentative and overly cautious.</mark> The impetus for the idea, according to the screenwriters Richard Levinson and William Link, came from "the fact that a homosexual friend of ours mentioned that his son was coming to visit him.

<mark>Yet not one gay hero emerged on the movie screen.</mark> In the 1970s, heroes who were gay in original source material were made heterosexual for the screen-just as their counterparts had been altered in the 1940s and 1950s. Gay fiction is now big business, but not one lesbian or gay literary hero has been successfully transferred to the screen. Film projects based on the life of gay tennis pro Bill Tilden and on James Kirkwood's novel *Good Times/Bad Times*, announced repeatedly in the trade press, have not materialized. Accord- ing to Andrew Sarris, the Tilden project was dropped because of "nervousness about its unsavory nature." The producer Ray Agayhan tried for three years to get a film version of Laura Z. Hobson's *Consenting Adult* off the ground in Hollywood. The story of a mother who must come to terms with her son's homosexuality, "it was turned down by all the major studios with enormous promptness," according to the author. Hobson could sell Hollywood Jews in 1947 with her *Gentleman's Agreement*, but she could not sell Hollywood gays in 1979. "They're scared to death of this one," she said.

At least not until the release of *Dog Day Afternoon*. The film, directed by Sidney Lamet<sup class="add">[sic: Lumet]</sup> and starring Al Pacino, is a complex and nuanced exploration of the queer experience. Set during a bank robbery gone awry in Brooklyn, the film tells the story of Sonny, a man who robs a bank in order to pay for Leon's (Sonny's partner's) gender confirmation surgery. (Leon isn't given a feminine name in the movie, FYI.)

As the story unfolds, we learn more about Sonny and Leon's relationship. We discover that Leon is a pre-op trans woman and Sonny is willing to do whatever it takes to support her, *including* robbing a bank to fund the procedure. This is a powerful statement about the lengths that queer people will go to in order to support and care for one another. Especially in a society that is often hostile and unwelcoming.

The film also explores the impact of queer identity on the character's relationships with their families. When Sonny's mother comes to the bank to try and talk him out of the robbery, he reveals to her that Leon is a trans woman. Her reaction... is one of shock and disgust. 

Another important queer theme in *Dog Day Afternoon* is the way that Sonny's sexuality and gender identity intersect with his working class background. Throughout the film we see Sonny interacting with other members of his community, including his friends and the police officers who are trying to negotiate with him. His working class background is an important part of his identity, and it's clear that he feels a sense of loyalty and connection to his community.

Ron Peck and Paul Hallam, <mark>the director and producer of the British film *Nighthawks* (1978), spent five years in planning and raising money for their film about a gay teacher (Ken Robertson) who spends his nights cruising in bars and discos and having one-night stands. *Nighthawks* provides an almost documentary look at the nighttime scene and the ritualistic life of one man who is beginning to realize that he leads two separate lives.</mark> In the climax of the film, the students in his geography class ask him if he is "queer," and he tells them he is gay. <mark>The dispassionate view of London gay nightlife allows a gay male audience to experience the hunt as more than a passive spectator. There is an uncanny feeling that each member of the audience is himself cruising, recognizing a look, a gesture, a glance, then realizing it is meant for the character in the film, through whose eyes we are looking. No slick and sensational Hollywood peep show, *Nighthawks* is a good, perceptive film with modest intentions, and it succeeds without compromising its scope for commercial reasons.</mark>

<mark>While William Friedkin was on New York's streets filming the blood-and-guts Hollywood version of the gay underground, *Nighthawks* opened in New York and got what turned out to be better reviews than Cruising would get six months later.</mark> Several mainstream critics, including Janet Maslin in the *New York Times* and David Denby in *New York* magazine, singled out *Nighthawks* as a film that managed to examine gay nightlife with sensitivity, intelligence and a respect for its main character. In his program note on the film, director Ron Peck wrote, "The film only shows one part of the gay scene it does not cover everything as many people may wish it did. But such a hope or expectation is only a reflection of the dire situation in which there are so few films with or about gay characters. Almost any film starts off with the burden of trying to redress an imbalance, to make homosexuality visible in the cinema. We need hundreds of gay films, not half a dozen." Peck's film, though praised by critics in several countries, was denied approval for showing in Greece in April 1980.

John Waters became *synonymous* with the queer underground cinema movement of the 1970s thanks to his outrageous and subversive style. Waters' films are known for their irreverent humor, over the top characters, and outrageous subject matter. He has always been drawn to the marginalized and the taboo, and his films often explore themes of sexuality, gender, and identity. Many of his films feature queer characters, and he has been credited with helping to break down barriers and challenge stereotypes about queer people. *Especially* the messy ones. And we love a messy queer.

Waters's film *Female Trouble*, released in 1974, is a classic example of his queer cinema. The film follows the story of Don Davenport, played by *the divine* Divine, who is a rebellious teenager with a troubled home life. She runs away from home and becomes involved in a series of crimes, ultimately leading to her downfall. The film features a cast of characters that includes drag queens, sex workers, and other outsiders, who challenge societal norms of gender and sexuality.

Another notable film in Waters' canon is *Desperate Living*. The film takes place in a fictional town called Mortville, where the residents are all social outcasts and deviants. The film features a cast of characters that includes a lesbian couple, a transgender woman, and a group of militant feminists. The film is a... ***dark*** comedy, that explores themes of power, privilege, and oppression. 

And, most iconically, there's *Pink Flamingos*. The queerness of this film is evident in the way it portrays its characters and its themes, and it remains a *potent* example of the power of queer cinema to disrupt and subvert *all expectations*.

One of the most striking aspects of *Pink Flamingos* is the way it portrays its central character. Divine is a *larger than life* figure, both in terms of her physical appearance and her personality. She is a force of nature, unapologetically embracing her own queerness, and challenging *anyone* who tries to limit or control her. Her sexuality is fluid, and she engages in relationships with both men and women throughout the film.

In addition to its portrayal of queer characters, *Pink Flamingos* also explores themes that are central to the queer experience. The film's focus on outsiders and those who are marginalized by mainstream society is a recurring theme throughout, with characters like Divine and her cohorts living on the fringes of society and rejecting traditional norms. At the same time, *Pink Flamingos* is also a celebration of queer culture, and a testament to the power of queer resilience. Despite the violence and degradation they face, Divine and her cohorts remain defiant, *refusing* to be cowed by the oppressive forces of society. Their queerness is a source of strength, and a way of connecting with others who share their experiences, creating a sense of community and belonging in the face of adversity.

Content warning, though. <u>[laughing]</u>

Waters' films are also notable for their celebration of Camp, a style that embraces theatricality and excess. Water's influence on the world of film and popular culture is *undeniable*. He has inspired countless artists and filmmakers, and his work has been celebrated for its subversive and irreverent humor. His films have also helped to pave the way for a greater representation of queer characters and stories in *mainstream* media. By challenging societal norms and pushing boundaries, Waters has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema and beyond. These queer underground round films opened the minds of many who wanted *nothing to do* with queer people.

Throughout the 1970s we continued to appear on some of the most popular TV shows in the world, such as *Dallas* and *MASH*. <mark fc=false>And in 1979, came the groundbreaking documentary *Before Stonewall*.</mark> The documentary combines archival footage, interviews with queer activists and scholars, and personal accounts to Chronicle the history of the queer community in America. It highlights the experiences of queer people in different regions of the country and in various spheres of society, including the arts, politics, and even Sports.

One of the documentary's key strengths is its emphasis on diversity in the queer community. The film showcases the lives of people like Bayard Rustin, a gay African-American civil rights leader who worked with Martin Luther King. And Sylvia Rivera, a transgender activist who played a *significant* role in The Stonewall Riots. Film and television were now being used to show the world that we were people. Complex and diverse. 

And with a burgeoning and queer political power structure rising up in California New York and DC, as well as a crop of new gay filmmakers beginning to be noticed by Hollywood, it seemed like we were ready to tear down those closet doors for good. And in the summer of 1981, pre-production had even begun on *Making Love*, a major studio film from 20th Century Fox about a married man coming to terms with his homosexuality and the love triangle that develops between him his wife and another man.

<u>[Music suddenly stops.]</u>  
But in that same summer... a rare cancer began appearing in gay men, followed by a cluster of pneumocystis pneumonia cases in San Francisco and New York. And then gay men across the world began dying. And suddenly *Hollywood's* opinion of us... didn't matter so much.
