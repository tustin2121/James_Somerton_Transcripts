In Hollywood's early years, homosexuality found its way on screen in ways both secret *and* obvious to the filmmakers behind the camera. Audiences *rarely* pushed back against these depictions, but those who *did* were loud, if not legion. Women's suffrage groups and the Catholic Church were the most dedicated to removing gay and lesbian content from Hollywood movies. 

And with the institution of the Motion Picture Production Code, they more or less succeeded. Filmmakers could now be fined or blacklisted for including gay and lesbian characters in their movies, and some films such as *Dracula's Daughter* were heavily edited to remove any overt lesbian content. But, go figure, a bunch of people who came up in the industry through artistic roots knew how to manipulate literary devices in visual language to still include gay themes and characters in their movies. Though in much less obvious ways.

Along with World War II and a coming end to what was referred to as the Golden Age of Hollywood, a time of gay invisibility had swept over the industry. But it was an invisibility that you *could see through*, if you knew how to look.

<mark x>Even though Hollywood didn't always tell the truth, this kept a lot of unwelcome facts and small problems from getting in the way of the American Dream.</mark> <mark>Even though gay and lesbian people were often the ones who made these dreams come true, they were never a part of it.</mark> 

<mark>It is said that Sam Goldwin</mark>, founder of Goldwyn Pictures, which was one of the three studios that merged to create MGM, <mark>once wanted to film *The Well of Loneliness* by Radcliffe Hall. But when a producer told him they couldn't because the main character was a lesbian</mark>, Goldwyn simply responded by saying:

> <mark>"So what? We'll make her American!"</mark>

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.celluloid_closet at="p62-63" %}>

<mark x>Hollywood's admittedly casual relationship with the truth protected the American dream from a host of unwanted realities and niggling intrusions.</mark> <mark>And while lesbians and gay men were often among the architects of that dream, they were never a part of it.</mark> <mark>It is said that Samuel Goldwyn</mark> <mark>once suggested filming Radclyffe Hall's notorious *The Well of Loneliness*, only to be informed by a producer that he could not because the leading character was a lesbian</mark>. <mark>"So what?" Goldwyn retorted. "We'll make her an American."</mark> Apocryphal or not, the simplicity of his solution captured the spirit of the truth. It was not as American as apple pie to be queer, and the closeted visions of countless gay screenwriters, directors, actors and technicians were submerged into the heterosexual, all-American fantasies of the majority. Gay characters and references to the existence of homosexuality were routinely laundered off the screen for the better part of half a century.

</from>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Despite Goldwyn's confusing lesbian for Lebanese, the <mark>Americanization of lesbianism</mark> *did* happen, and <mark>meant</mark> nothing more than the <mark>simple *refusal* to deal with it honestly</mark>. It was an <mark>imitation of the American fear of sexuality in general and the American duplicity regarding sexual deviance in particular.</mark>

In all <mark x>actuality, it was the same invisibility that gays experienced in *real* life, only replicated in the movies.</mark> Despite this gays <mark>continued to make an appearance as subtextual phantoms that represented the fear of homosexuality</mark> itself. They <mark>served as his alien life forms that were yet *firmly established* as part of the culture in every walk of life</mark>. <mark>And they formed the shadowy counterpart to the concept of the American dream.</mark>

<mark num=9>Sissies and tomboys were used as yardsticks for what was deemed acceptable behavior</mark> <mark num=10>in a culture that was so preoccupied with the upkeep of sex norms and the celebration of everything masculine</mark>. 

</james>
<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.celluloid_closet at="p63" %}>

And so the <mark>Americanization of lesbianism</mark> <mark>meant</mark> <mark>simply an unwillingness to deal with it openly</mark>, an <mark>aping of the American cowardice about sex in general and the American hypocrisy about sexual deviation in particular.</mark> <mark x>Technically. homosexuals were just as invisible onscreen as they were in real life.</mark> They <mark>continued to emerge, however, as subtextual phantoms representing the very fear of homosexuality</mark>. <mark>Serving as alien creatures who were nonetheless firmly established as part of the culture in every walk of life</mark>, <mark>they became the darker side of the American dream.</mark> <mark num=10>In a society so obsessed with the maintenance of sex roles and the glorification of all things male</mark>, <mark num=9>sissies and tomboys served as yardsticks for what was considered normal behavior</mark>. The discomfort that has consistently arisen in response to "buddy" films springs from the paranoia and fear that surrounds exclusively male relationships. American society has always begun at square one, with the belief that men are never attracted to each other as masculine equals (one of them is always seen as wanting to be a woman or to act like one). Thus the denial of the existence of homosexuality did not suppress the national fear of it but instead served to point it up continu&shy;ally. Nor did this denial belie for long the fact of it in history.

One performer who happily ignored these sex Norms was <mark x>Greta Garbo, whose performance as Queen Christina in the film of the same name released in</mark> <mark fc=false>1934</mark>, was a challenge to the standards of sexual and gender behavior that were considered acceptable at the time. It was <mark>the collision on screen of her own androgynous aesthetic, with the reality of Christina's affinity for masculine clothes and activities, that gave the picture a realism that was uniquely its own.</mark>

<mark>Garbo — who would express</mark> <mark>her desire to be in a film version of Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, with herself in the title role and Marilyn Monroe as a young girl ruined by Dorian — created a particular dynamic in *Queen Christina*, one that penetrated the queer erasure of the script. Her forlorn longings to escape her gloomy destiny of marriage and her skillful rejection of a series of male suitors are broken in the first part of the film by her encounter with the Countess Ebba Sparre, played by a Elizabeth Young.</mark> 

<mark>Their brief scene together is charged with sexuality and real affection</mark>. <mark>In that scene, Garbo lifts the emotional barriers to characterize her encounters with mail suitors.</mark> <mark>Ebba suggests brightly that they go for a sleigh ride, but Christina tells her sadly</mark>:

The movie was released late 1933.

In 1933, less than a year before <mark x>the release of Queen Christina, Rouben Mamoulian's romantic fantasy starring Greta Garbo</mark> as the Swedish monarch, Elizabeth Goldsmith published Christina of Sweden ("A Psychological Biogra&shy;phy"). In reviewing the book and anticipating the film by Mamoulian, Lewis Gannett wrote in the New York Herald Tribune, "The one persistent love of Christina's life was for the Countess Ebba Sparre, a beautiful Swedish noble. woman who lost most of her interest in Christina when Christina ceased to rule Sweden . . . the evidence is overwhelming, but will Miss Garbo play such a Christina?"

Garbo did no such thing, of course, but <mark>the collision onscreen of her own androgynous sensibility with the fact of Christina's love for male attire and pursuits gave the film a truth of its own.</mark> <mark>Garbo, who once expressed</mark> to Katharine Comell <mark>her desire to play in a film version of Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray* with herself in the title role and Marilyn Monroe as a young girl ruined by Dorian, created a particular dynamic in *Queen Christina*, one which penetrated the fundamental deceptions of the script. Her melancholy longings to escape her destiny (marriage) and her deft rejections of a series of male suitors are interrupted in the first half of the film by her encounter with the Countess Ebba. Sparre (Elizabeth Young).</mark> <mark>Their brief scene together is charged with sexuality and real affection</mark>, the only such display in the film between Garbo and another woman. <mark>In that scene Garbo lifts the emotional barriers that characterize her encounters with male suitors.</mark> When Ebba bursts into the queen's chamber, the two kiss passionately on the lips. <mark>Ebba suggests brightly that they go for a sleighride, but Christina tells her sadly</mark> that Parliament awaits and that they will see each other that evening. "Oh, no we won't!" Ebba pouts. "You'll be surrounded by musty old men and musty old papers, and I won't be able to get near you." The Queen caresses her face gently and promises that they will soon go away to the country together "for two whole days."

He takes an order for two morning chocolates and withdraws in astonishment.

In the early days of Hollywood, *Queen Christina* stood out due to the fact that it included a character that was unmistakably bisexual. As well as many instances of bisexuality in the narrative of the film itself. 

At the time, <mark>the lives of notable gay men and lesbians were</mark> either portrayed in a manner that was <mark>drastically different</mark> from their actual experiences, <mark>or were not addressed at all</mark> in biographical films. This straight-washing of history has only *marginally* changed in modern cinema, as seen by the fact that films such as *Troy*, *A Beautiful Mind*, and *The Imitation Game* more or less ignore or completely *erase* the fact that its primary characters are gay or bisexual.

It's one of the reasons why audience members were taken aback by the lesbian relationships that were depicted in *The Favorite*. Even in the late 2010s, audiences of historical biopics *anticipated* that queerness would be erased from historical recreations.

<from {% include citation for=page.cite.plagiarized.celluloid_closet at="p65" %}>

Accidents such as the collision of Garbo's chemistry and Christina's stubborn maleness, the kind that produce something more than is in the script, happen rarely, though not as a rule in biographies; <mark>the lives of famous lesbians and gay men were</mark> <mark>altered significantly</mark> <mark>or were not attempted</mark>. The need for invisibil&shy;ity is reflected in the very character of the American experience: heroes may certainly not be homosexual. Real-life gays almost never tampered with the illusions; rather, they subscribed to them. In 1946, Cole Porter and Monty Woolley, lifelong friends but not lovers, created their own dismal myth in Warner Brothers' Technicolor musical "biography" of Porter, Night and Day. Porter and his wife Linda, by choosing Cary Grant and Alexis Smith for the title roles, opted for a sophisticated Ozzie and Harriet look while Monty Woolley, playing himself, chose the grand old man of letters motif- pinching the chorus girls and all the rest of the heterosexual repertoire.

<mark>The portrayal of noted persons as heterosexual, without regard for their true to life sexuality, has never been seen as a serious offense against a person's identity</mark> until recently. <mark>Not even by the person whose life is falsified.

Films such as *The Agony and the Ecstasy* (1965) and *Khartoum* (1966) reflected the care with which their sources masked or denied the homosexuality of Michelangelo and General Charles Gordon, just as uninspired confections of the Fifties such as *Valentino* (1951), *Hans Christian Andersen* (1952) and *Alexander the Great* (1956) bypassed history for the safe illusions held tightly by the majority.

But there was an odd dichotomy developing in Hollywood, whereas lesbian or bisexual female characters could be *redeemed* in a film by being paired off with the right man in the end, bisexual or gay *male* characters had no such luxury. <mark>In the film *Adam's Rib*, which was released in 1949,</mark> <mark>David Wayne plays the role of Kip, who is a yardstick sissy par excellence.</mark>

Kip <mark>serves as Katherine Hepburn's... girlfriend.

Open contempt for men who are perceived to be like women was not new. In John Ford's Three Bad Men (1926), the grizzly "Bull" (J. Farrell MacDonald) tells a fancy Dan who says he has just reached manhood, "Then you'd better reach again." Essentially the same scene occurs <mark>in the "feminist" *Adam's Rib* (1949)</mark>, <mark>in which David Wayne's Kip, a yardstick sissy par excellence</mark>, <mark>functions as Katharine Hepbum's girlfriend, a high-class Ethel Mertz to her feminist Lucy Ricardo.</mark> <mark num=5>Spencer Tracy is clearly uncomfortable with him</mark> <mark num=4>in spite of Hepbum's defense</mark> ("Oh, darling.

Again, these interpretations arise invariably from the fear of homosexuality, seldom from the fact of it. The expendability of women in buddy films was one reason for that fear.

But the director <mark>seldom commented on such aspects of his work</mark>. <mark>"We never discussed, Hitch and I, whether the characters in Rope were homosexuals</mark>," Laurents says, "<mark>but I thought it was apparent.</mark>" 

> <mark>I guess he did, too, but it never came up until we got to casting.</mark> <mark>We'd wanted Cary Grant for the teacher and Montgomery Clift for one of the boys, and they both turned it down for the same reason&mdash;their image.</mark> <mark>They felt they couldn't risk it.</mark> <mark>Eventually John Dall and Farley Granger played the boys, and they were very aware of what they were doing.</mark> Jimmy Stewart, however, who played the teacher, wasn't at all. And if you asked Hitchcock, he'd tell you it isn't there, knowing perfectly well that it is. He was interested in perverse sexuality of any kind, and he used it for dramatic tension. But being a strong Catholic, he probably thought it was wrong. The homosexuality between the two men, after all, in Strangers on a Train, isn't in the script, yet it's there. Farley Granger told me once that <mark>it was Robert Walker's idea to play Bruno Anthony as a homosexual.</mark>

<mark>Philip and Brandon, the lovers in *Rope*, were warped individuals who murdered out of a belief in their own moral and intellectual superiority. Which they believed placed them outside the law.

<mark>The view of the homosexual as being alien to his own society was also present in the constant *deletion* of specific homosexuality from the screen adaptations of literary works</mark>. <mark>In 1945, Billy Wilder brought Charles Jackson's novel *The Lost Weekend* to the screen with Ray Milland as the alcoholic writer Don Burnham. In Jackson's novel, Burnham's alcoholism stems from a complex variety of reasons that include a father fixation and a false accusation of his having had a gay relationship with a college frat brother.</mark> <mark>In Wilder's version of *The Lost Weekend*, however, the motivation for Burnham's drinking becomes a simple case of writer's block.</mark>

<mark>The view of the homosexual as being alien to his own society was also present in the constant deletion of specific homosexuality from the screen adaptations of literary works</mark> in the Forties. <mark>In 1945, Billy Wilder brought Charles Jackson's novel *The Lost Weekend* to the screen with Ray Milland as the alcoholic writer Don Birnam. In Jackson's novel, Birnam's alcoholism stems from a complex variety of reasons that includes a father fixation and a false accusation of his having had a homosexual relationship with a college fraternity brother.</mark> (Other Jackson books had had gay themes; a subplot in The Fall of Valor involved a marine and a married man.) <mark>In Wilder's version of *The Lost Weekend*, however, the motivation for Birnam's drinking became a simple case of writer's block.</mark> Seemingly a victim of the same problems that would later beset Tom Lee in *Tea and Sympathy*, Jackson's Don Birnam is also "saved" by the love of a good woman. But in the film, Jane Wyman saves Ray Milland from his alcoholism, not from the cause of it. Paramount studio boss Buddy DeSylva stated the reason for the script changes: "If the drunk isn't an extremely attractive fellow who, apart from being a drunk, could be a hell of a nice guy, the audiences won't go for it."
