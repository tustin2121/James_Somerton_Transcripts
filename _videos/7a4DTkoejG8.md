> **Courtney:** But he *did* add a pinned post under that video that said something along the lines of, “Just remember, this is *one Ace’s experience*. We’re not talking for all of the Aces that exist out there.” But he said, “My comments section is gonna be a safe place for Aces to share their experience. I will be moderating.” [...] He added that after this, you know, this livestream, this blowing up on Twitter about all this...
>
> **Courtney:** And so, *just for funsies*, I went through every single comment on that video, of which there were ***thousands***. And, uh, either he wasn’t moderating at all and he just lied, or <span stat:id="y-acephobia">he’s really okay with acephobia</span> and his moderating leaves a lot to be desired. Because I saw tons of personal attacks. I saw several Aces *sharing* their honest to God personal experiences about facing conversion therapy, as a direct result of what they said in that video, and there were people in the comments being like, “Okay, but Aces literally don’t have it as bad as gays. Stop pretending like you have it as bad as we gays have it,” to people saying, like, “Yeah, I got sent to a conversion therapy camp,” or, like, “Yeah, my doctor tried to cure my Asexuality.” Those did not get moderated. I saw vile things being said to Aces in the comments that did not get removed. 
>
> **Courtney:** I saw slurs. [...] So they take the F-slur, replace the first three letters with A-C-E. So there are people who will, like, call us “acegot,” which we’ve made fun of on this podcast before, actually. [...] It doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. It’s clunky. [...]  I saw that several times in that comments section. And that I could have given a pass on. Like, maybe you don’t know enough about the Asexual community in order to appropriately moderate that, because it’s a bit obscure [...] But the outright attacks talking about, “Don’t pretend like you have it as bad as us gays” — it’s like, was that not what this video was supposed to be about, was telling gays not to do that anymore? Literally.

Hello everyone, and welcome to "Gays Behaving Badly", a new feature on the channel that we're gonna try out for a bit, and if you like it let us know in the comments. My name is James.

I'm Nick.

And Gays Behaving Badly is basically a podcast with cameras. We will be discussing things that the... queer community doesn't like to talk about or doesn't like to acknowledge very much.

Uh this first episode we're going to be talking about the... kind of queer Erasure of all of asexual and asexuality and aromanticism from the LGBTQ+-ness.

> **Courtney:** But immediately off the bat watching this episode, we were like, “Oh no. We gave this guy money to do Ace rep. What have we done?” It was bad, y’all.

The Ace Couple explain in their podcast that they had given Telos Pictures CAD$ 1500+ in hopes that they could help/encourage the studio when it came to ace representation in their media.

> **Courtney:** Right off the bat it was bad. I’m not going to say every single thing in that episode was bad, because later on, there was more of Nick talking about their own experiences and their perspective on things. And that was fine, and that was great, and I think those sections was what more people in the Ace community really resonated with as they were tuning in. 
>
> **Courtney:** But before getting to the point of sharing personal experiences, there were a lot of blanket statements that were absolutely factually wrong. And not only factually wrong, but very much erasing the real Ace experience, which was — the subject of this podcast was “We can’t keep doing this to Aces! We shouldn’t be erasing them.” 
>
> **Courtney:** And yet, the impression I got: James is clearly allosexual. He does not understand the Ace experience. Nick does identify as Ace and has his own personal experience. That’s fine and well and good. But I very much got the impression watching this that Nick perhaps first identified as gay before later learning about the components of Asexuality that are applicable to them. 
> 
> **Courtney:** And that’s fine, that happens. That *absolutely* happens a lot in the Ace community. There’s nothing wrong with that. But there seemed to be a lot of blind spots in the broader Ace experience and issues actually faced en masse by the community. Nick seemed a lot more educated on gay issues than Ace issues. So despite being Ace, I’m pretty sure Nick has not spent a lot of quality time in and around the Ace community.

They proceed to talk about how they made a Twitter thread, gently correcting the information in this video.

</comment>
<nick>

Yeah, the ace spectrum. Um... that's kind of one of the um...

It's in a lot of ways considered one of the ugly stepchildren of the queer community and um... When I was working in queer circles I... there was that kind of discussion...

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

You worked for a pride organization once.

</james>
<nick>

There was that discussion, very innocently had, about like.... like, they wanted to make sure that only queer groups got like a... There was kind of a... a kiosk sort of station, where were different groups and organizations would set up kiosks that people could visit. And there was a-- and they wanted to make sure that only queer people could *have* these spots, because what would happen is people would just kind of get a spot. Even though they had nothing really to do with queerness.

Um, so like there was kind of an asexual group and there was a discussion like... is that specifically a queer group?

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've seen that a lot because... there's a "debate" among... especially, I've seen it among gay men that asexual people shouldn't be included so much, because you know asexual people are not persecuted-- actively persecuted for their sexuality. 

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I-- I-- I-- I see that sort of... angle, however my justification--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I'm not saying I agree with that [Inaudible], by the way.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

oh yeah yeah, that's the information, but my justification for why--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

We should just call this "Disclaimer: the Podcast".

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

\[Laughter]

My-- My organization-- My sort of qualification for this (and we've talked about this and you agree) is, um... that the queer community is a community of people established by a means of exclusion. Uh, we weren't collected in the hegemony, so we kind of banded together.

And <mark yikes id="no-persecution" stat:id="y-acephobia">while there might be no specific persecution for asexual people in the way that *gay* people have faced</mark>, there is a kind of very quiet persecution for asexuals. It seem as being-- For instance, I think uh asexuality in the American Psychological Journal is still qualified as a mental-- As a psychological disease, a mental health disease.

Correct me if I'm wrong. But like... when you are asexual you do see a myriad of ways that, uh, there's basically a psychological warfare against you. *Every* piece of media is focused around a romance or sexual attraction. It's seen as a for-granted thing for almost every piece of media, almost everyone there's that sexual expectation...

In this part of the podcast, they begin reading to the record [the twitter thread they wrote](https://twitter.com/The_Ace_Couple/status/1593065297061498880) ([nitter mirror](https://nitter.net/The_Ace_Couple/status/1593065297061498880)):

> We were excited to see @je_somerton center Asexual issues. It's rare and we desperately need more allyship for & from all corners of the queer community, but [by] 4 minutes we were disappointed at the inaccuracy. Respectfully we want to add to the conversation.

> Statements like "<mark>While there might be no specific persecution for asexual people in the way that gay people have faced</mark>" and "<mark>While there isn't really any conversion therapy directed at asexuals</mark>" are factually incorrect and we'd like to set the record straight.

> UK studies have shown that 10% of asexuals have been offered or undergone conversion therapy as opposed to the 7% figure for the entirety of the queer community overall. Aces are only beaten in percentage by trans conversion therapy sitting at 13% [banconversiontherapy.com](https://www.banconversiontherapy.com/)

> The full report also shows asexuals reporting the lowest levels of life satisfaction and are least likely to be out. [[link to summary report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b3cb6b6ed915d39fd5f14df/GEO-LGBT-Survey-Report.pdf)]

This is the report the website cites: The Government Equalities Office's [National LGBT Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report) from July 2018.

Twitter thread continues:
> Nearly every ace who has joined an asexual group on facebook has been inundated with ads for libido medication. We aren't always safe to come out to doctors. Thankfully the video mentioned asexuality still being considered a mental health disorder, this only scratches the surface.
>
> We understand that Nick who made this claim is Ace and on matters of opinion alone, we try not to correct our fellow aces, but we are still subject to many medical discriminations and outright stating that conversion therapy is not one of them is incompetent.
>
> As married Aces, we've also spoken at length about the legal issues pertaining to asexual marriages in the US. Asexual persecutions happen, they just don't make news headlines and are rarely reported appropriately. Same can be said with hate crimes.

They quote-tweet [a previous thread](https://twitter.com/The_Ace_Couple/status/1564757917454286848#m) ([nitter mirror](https://nitter.net/The_Ace_Couple/status/1564757917454286848#m)) about their 4 part series of episodes about religious and political discrimination: [part 1](https://theacecouple.com/episode045/), [part 2](https://theacecouple.com/episode046/), [part 3](https://theacecouple.com/episode047/), and [part 4](https://theacecouple.com/episode048/).

Twitter thread continues:
> A few years ago, an ace teenage girl was very publicly murdered by an incel. It wasn't reported a hate crime. Even though she'd come out and engaged with the ace online community, her parents did not believe she was ace and accused us of "pushing our agenda" when we were mourning.
>
> Aces are also proven to be evaluated more negatively, viewed as less human, and less valued as contact partners, relative to heterosexuals and other sexual minorities. [[Link to research article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368430212442419)]
>
> We appreciate that James mentioned that he doesn't agree with the takes that asexuals aren't queer because we aren't persecuted, but please don't then simultaneously ignore or minimize the issues that we DO face.
>
> We were very excited to donate to Telos Pictures and we still have hopes that you will help produce some more much needed, positive Ace representation, but we also hope that you will speak to more Aces from a wider variety of backgrounds in order to do us proper justice.

And even when there's not, it's... Viewers will *assume* that (especially if there's a male and female character), if there isn't a romance between them viewers will assume by the end of the movie or the TV show that there *will* be.

</james>
<nick>

Right, absolutely, and-- and outside of media in like sort of... polite discussion... There's a way that people kind of, you know, when you're outside of polite discussion, and you're kind of being more personal with someone, there's a comfort with sex that is taken for granted. Like, you know, if you're having, you know, a rough time, your close friend might say, "just go out and shag someone".

And that's kind of seen as just like a universal. So it's a lot of very subtle ways that the hegemony reminds you that you're not really welcome. Or that you should be different. Or that you're there's something wrong with you. 

</nick>
<nick>

<mark yikes id="conversion-therapy" stat:id="y-acephobia">And while there isn't really any conversion therapy directed to the asexual people...</mark> and while you think that there wouldn't be because society is kind of geared towards this neopuritan attitude of avoiding sex and avoiding uh sexual attraction at least in public discourse and especially like in public areas... there is that expectation that it's something that *is* going to happen behind closed doors.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. Again, just kind of going back to the idea of that in media... if there's not the romantic interest, if there's not the sexual interest, that there will be... the assumption, because the... overt sexuality is the default.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Oh yeah yeah yeah.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Um, and like you said, that there's not like conversion therapy for-- for ace people, but I think there's a huge amount of social pressure. So there's not like... organized--

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And you want to sort of have evidence of what you're saying about there being like an expectation of sexuality. Take two queer-coded characters, or a queer-coded character, and straight people will automatically assume that they are straight. Like look at Yuri from-- Victor from Yuri on Ice. There is a huge straight component of the audience for that show that assumes that Victor is straight and hypersexual--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Which is hilarious.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Which is hilarious. Because he's the bottom um... so like there's that expectation that it's going to be there, even if, in the media, it's not depicted that way, very clearly. But like and asexuality is beginning to be discussed in a larger, broader context nowadays. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I feel like with-- sorry for interrupting, I feel like we should pause and just kind of explain to anyone who *doesn't* know what asexuality is.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That's what we're getting. That's what we're getting. There's a perception of what it is, uh-- There's a perception of it, versus what it is. And this discussion... The ways that asexuality is beginning to manifest, in sort of representation in media and a discussion in public. Even when it's done well, it's usually-- Or when it's done earnestly, it's usually only ever sort of half-baked. It's a much larger spectrum. It's a larger fish pond than what people see. So there's-- 

Asexuality is defined as a aversion to sex, lack of sexual drive, lack of sexual attraction, um... And that's kind of where the definition is formally very very vaguely. It's very unspecific. 
{% assign timecode = "6:32" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Because there is, you know... Obviously within sexuality, there is a spectrum of sexuality, but there is just as big a spectrum within asexuality. Of where you kind of land...

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

But the public perception of asexuality is Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I don't even think it's Sheldon, because Sheldon does have sex and does get married...

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I know but like... once again like... That's true, actually. Um, because well, I see that it is asexual, it's like a lot of people in the audience might think "oh Sheldon is *no longer* asexual". 

When I was kind of experimenting around with kind of identifying as asexual in university, I was kind of close with this one girl who lacked a lot of social skills... and when she did get a boyfriend she was like, "Guess what: I'm no longer asexual!"

And I think that's how a lot of people feel that it *does* work, it's like-- it's like the bisexual thing: when you get married to a man or a woman, it's like no longer straight, or no longer gay.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, as soon as you-- you know, if you're a man and you start dating-- this is-- this is oddly a belief within the queer community especially, *especially* among gay men, is that if a man is bisexual and starts dating a woman he's actually not bisexual. He was, you know, just looking for some--

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And if you get married, you're Straight For Life. --to a woman-- to a woman. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, your bisexuality just disappears suddenly--

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And if you get married to a-- And if you shack up with a guy or get married to a guy, it's like, "well, it's just a transitional period."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

"Oh, you're gay now." well yeah that's- that was a big thing for bisexuality, it was bi now gay later. Um, because-- 

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And like I understand why that existed at the time because we came from a very... 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Binary system.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Not just a binary system but a very persecutional system where being bisexual meant that you could still latch
onto some of that straight privilege. Um, and make it easier-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

You didn't *have* to get a boyfriend.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, and sort of make an easier transition into this kind of sexuality. Um, I've actually heard the inverse too, that people will kind of, um, they'll be straight and then they'll "snap" to dating a guy and be like, "oh I guess I'm gay now." And then they'll realize, "wait a second, I still like girls." 

So um, I think that's where a lot of the perception that bi people are sneaky, um, very wrongly came from because we have this idea - we were talking about this the other day - that there isn't really room for experimentation in society. You're not really allowed to experiment or play around or sort of investigate different things. It's like, when you are- when you begin to exhibit signs of being gay, "oh, you're just gay." It's like there's no room for fluidity. Um, but-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Back to the asexuals.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That was- I was flipping that around! I was saying like asexuality is actually a lot more fluid than people think it is. Because Sheldon *can* get married and he-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well I don't think Sheldon was ever- ever conceived-

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

I'm using that as an example. I'm using that as an example.
{% assign timecode = "9:14" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, that's what people think of asexual as, the people who just have no, uh sexual drive, who have no interest in sex, who have no interest in romance, who have no interest in any kind of pairing whatsoever.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That's also not the- Well yeah that is the-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

That's the *assumption* from the masses.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yes, yes, sorry. [laughs]

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

That's the assumption, whereas in reality, like I said there is a spectrum of asexuality that goes from that to any number of other options.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

And something that we're beginning to realize is that there is a separation between asexuality and
aromantic. Which I feel a little bit concerned, the thing I'm starting, I'm starting to see, not that I'm concerned, I'm starting to see a trend for people to describe asexuality as aroace. I'm like, "that's not necessarily the case."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah that's kind of the um- the LGBTQ kind of- yeah, "we'll just call
you LGBTQ," it's like, "Actually, I'm a lesbian." It's like, "well you're LGBTQ."

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Some people are aroace and they have neither romantic nor sexual attraction to
anyone.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But some people can fall in love very easily with no sexual attraction
and some people can be *very* horny with no romantic attraction.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Talk to any asexual person and they will tell you that they are incredibly kinky and horny. Since- wait no.

If you want a more in-depth look at how kink and asexuality go together, I recommend [The Ace Couple's Podcast, episode 62](https://theacecouple.com/episode062/). This video even makes a cameo in the episode!

</comment>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Not *any* asexual person! [laughter] I mean there's plenty of asexual people who have no interest in any sex.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

That's true, there is- within the community there is kind of a marked, um, acknowledgment, a very quiet
acknowledgment that some of the kinkiest people you ever meet are identifying as asexual. Uh, cause they keep their sex up here. [points to their own head.] Like, they just don't let it get out of their head. It's-

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It's- it's all internal and because it never has to exist in real life, they never have to face the ickiness.

I'm pretty sure that a very strong component of fanfiction, like slash fiction, erotic fan fiction, um, libraries are contributed to by asexual people. [laughter]

We're back! All right, so this is I guess... segment two. Um, so kinky! You were talking about kinky.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yes, I was talking about kinky. Um and this is kind of the appearance versus reality of asexuality. The reality of asexual sexuality is that it is a very broad area and this has troubles translating into the dating world. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I can imagine.

</james>
</compare>
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah. Because for me online on Grindr, the things that I will say to people, first of all hopefully will never get leaked into the world, uh... second of all, I... before I meet a guy and this was a historic thing I had to kind of give a disclaimer, like, "hey, heads up I know we've been talking about certain things but I need to tell you that the more you get to know me in person, I'm not as horny as I seem to be." And that's just because I have a very active imagination and I really--

<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, you're a writer.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, I enjoy the idea of sex. Um, but like there are some branches of asexuality which much prefer to do sex online, or sex on the phone, uh, sex in a hypothetical context. Some prefer-- Some do not like penetration and like uh...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And I mean that's becoming a whole thing within the gay community now, is, you know there's tops and bottoms and verse blah blah, but now there's sides, which are people who do enjoy sex but not penetrative sex.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

yeah, and I, I really like that that... I always thought that butt sex was a little bit overrated. And just just-- but a huge portion is the idea that so many gay people (and you might qualify as this) don't think that it counts as sex unless it's-- unless it's penetrative.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've actually really changed my mind about that, even-- even as of six months ago I was very in the backward thinking of like, "sex needs to be penetrative, if it's not then it doesn't count." And you know I've really come around to that because.. you know, sex I think to me now encompasses such a wide range from the most intense, sweaty, nasty thing that you know Treasure Island Media produces, to, you know, phone sex. And/or making out in the back of a car, and you know it all depends, it's a personal person.

Greater separation between like sex-- a sex act, I qualify anything as a "sex act" as a sexual encounter. Anything with the intention of having that kind of sexual passion associated with it. 

Um... And so like there there is a lot of um... explaining that I have to do... and usually I get ghosted... after that because it's like... 'cause I can see where they're coming-- where guys are coming from in that case. Because it's like, "oh, you're suddenly getting cold feet and you need an out." Um, and that's kind of how I get that kind of "out" feeling sometimes...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>
  
Yeah, like people would could look at that as, you know, that you're really just looking that you're-- oh what's the term?

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>
  
Screening?

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

No, maybe, something like that but it's- there's a specific term for it for people who are just.. they just want to, you know, "cyber" and that's it. They'll lead you on for weeks and weeks and weeks.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

(I have done that...) Um, because like sometimes I...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I need like a "bonk", I could go like, [mimes hitting Nick with a newspaper] bad!

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

[laughs] Well, listen what that is, I'm never dishonest about it. I sort of am upfront and I say, like, "I'm not really interested in meeting up," um... but I love doing cyber, I love talking to people, and regardless of that there is still an ongoing expectation that, "oh we're gonna meet up eventually, he's just saying he's not into meeting people so he can bypass all of the undesirable-- whoops- I'll bypass all the undesirable gays!" Um, and when I was kind of coming of age on gay dating--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>
  
And that isn't-- that's the first I've ever heard about that just today, the "screening process". That there are people that will put on the that kind of asexual-esque gaze to kind of screen out the ones they're really not interested in.
{% assign timecode = "15:33" %}

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick {% include timecode %}>

'Cause like, you know, when I was kind of coming of age on Grindr there was a big thing to sort of say, "not into meeting up," "not into hooking up." Um, and I *like* that because sometimes I *wasn't.* But then sometimes I was, and I would find the right personal and realize, "Oh. People are doing this maliciously." They are doing this to screen out people who are not physically attractive, they're not-- they're not physically attracted to. Um... And so when you did get that kind of good chemistry, regardless of whether you wanted to meet or not, the other person would have that expectation because it's like, "oh, I passed the screening process."
{% assign timecode = "0:00" %}

So, when you would kind of-- when it would become a- became *apparent* that you weren't really as into hookup culture as they wanted to be, or thought you would be, they kind of just abandoned you. Um, And when you *were* up front and you said like, "I'm not really into meeting up, I just want to talk", I think they got the vibes that I was just consistently going to be putting them off, or that they would eventually pass the test one day, and you know, would get to do the physical stuff. 

But it took me a long time to sort of be comfortable with like being not as... intimately sexual with people. And I kind of, for the sake of being polite, I forced myself into a lot of kind of hookups that I wasn't really that interested in, or that I knew I wasn't going to have a fun time from the beginning. Not that there was any consent problems, it's just that I wasn't really into it, and I was kind of like-- it was kind of like, you know, laying there like a fish. [laughs]
{% assign timecode = "17:00" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And yeah, it seems like -- from the asexual people that I've talked to -- that it's- it's like a second coming out process. That. you know, you kind of spend your teenage years figuring out if you're gay or bi--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Because you *think* you *have* to be hypersexual, because that's the kind of depiction--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>
  
Especially with the gay community. Like, we have kind of-- the culture, the gay culture, has really, up until *very* recently when it was kind of-- the gay culture has become two dads and a kid in the suburbs, that it was circuit parties, and, you know, ecstasy, and stuff like that. That gay culture was the height and the- the- the absolute peak of sexuality. And so, how can you be gay and asexual?

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

On that regard, even if you are-- Even if you are that kind of monogamous kind of person, like when-- watch any gay drama, like Elite. (Is it Elites, or Elite?)

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Uh that's not just gay, that's gay and straight. *Very* hypersexual.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

I know, I know, but like, when you were-- when you did get a permanent, you know, boyfriend, you would kind of... when the door is closed, *oof!* That's when the heat would hit, like...
{% assign timecode = "17:58" %}

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. It's like, "okay now we need to-- you know, the sweat needs to start pouring off of us. It needs to be a porno film. And if it's anything less then we're doing it wrong."

Especially when- when you're gay, the only-- when you're specifically attracted-- a man attracted to men, or you know um... then it's very much... that *is* your early exposure to gayness. There's not a whole lot of, you know like, kids movies with a child-- There's no *Little Rascals* for gay people, where there's a childhood romance.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

It's like, you watch the kind of raunchy gay movies a *little* bit earlier, because you're much more curious than your peers, so that's kind of, you know, you're hypersexual. Like you and *Queer as Folk*! 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, like I, uh-- *Queer as Folk* was really my first, um... not my *first* exposure to gay people, but it was certainly the most, um...

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

So like you know-- you young little gayby comes of age, and like it's their exposure to, "oh this is how I be gay as an adult".

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, that "this is what gayness as is as an adult. This is what gayness is in high school, even."

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

But the- the- the other side of that, is this kind of-- And that you have that, and that conflicts with the perception of asexuality. Which is the "doesn't have sex" and-- in media, this is very often the case, and a lot of asexual people are kind of upset by this, asexuality is represented by robots, aliens, and autistic people. And as it happens a lot--

And rarely confirmed in any of those cases.

</james>
<nick>

Yeah. A lot of-- Or completely unconfirmed and just not acknowledged, like with Elsa. In a lot of those cases like, asexual people don't really like that, because we can be incredibly vibrant, colorful, zany people uh--

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well, yeah, I don't know any asexual people who are like Sheldon or Data. 

</james>
<nick>

And even then, like... I think that's... 

Data was snarky, though.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've never seen Star Trek, I'm just going by YouTube clips.

</james>
<nick>

When I was younger, my mom said that I was a carbon copy of Data. I always loved the character, because my mom had Star Trek on a lot when I was younger. And like, I think that's a discredit to autistic people too. I identify as somewhere on the spectrum. I don't know what, but-- because like autistic people can be incredibly hypersexual, and that's perfectly fine too! And so like kind of pigeonholing these identities together because you know this privileged-- writer of privilege, this creator of privilege, has this one experience with this one person, thinks "oh, this one this must be what it's like for everyone".

So, those are two very conflicting public perceptions of what these identities ought to be. And when you put them together it's--- what do you get? Like people just don't believe you. You have no idea how many times I've gotten... Like I said "I'm asexual" and then kind of get the retort, "Oh, you just haven't met the right person." 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Oh I-- I absolutely believe that. Um, that's-- I've seen that in so many different conversations and podcasts and whatnot. People kind of talking about, you know, "I'll tell someone I'm asexual" and it's just, "oh, you just haven't met the right guy yet." Um, and it's the same with-- It's the same kind of thing with women who say like, "I never want to get married", and it's, "you just haven't met the right guy yet", or "I never want to have a kid" and it's--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>

Yeah, it's just like, "You'll change your mind."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

"You'll change your mind." Yeah, "once it happens you'll change your mind" kind of thing. Um, and so that seems to be a-- that seems to be a societal thing, that if you're anywhere outside of the societal norm, which is very restrictive-- like I said, even a woman who doesn't want to get married is outside the societal norm. Society kind of says to you like, "just wait, you'll get there."

</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, and that's- that's what I was going to say is that, when you do kind of put it on the table that like, "I don't really like sex very much, but with the right person... you know, I will lower my boundaries and I'll do it," which kind of poses the question, how- "are you asexual enough?"

I think there's more people who would identify with asexual if they realized that
it wasn't, you know, Sheldon and Data.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, that it was an option. The discussion of what is ace enough comes up from a matter of, some ace people do enjoy some kind of sex, in different circumstances. Um, but the question arises, um you know, what qualifies as asexual. Because you get the purists who say "ace or aromantic means that you have no sexual desire or that you have no romantic connections." Uh, but some people have these things but in very specific circumstances. You mentioned people who like to only do it for cyber. Um, there are--  

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. People who only are into cyber sex, people who only like to have sex with people they are in love with, people who don't like- who only like to have sex with people they have no romantic connection with.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Uh, there's some debate about like, does a side qualify? Like, you know you have tops, bottoms and sides, is that asexual? Because you know, they don't enjoy penetration. Um, and I kind of fit into that kind of camp, like-- 
</nick>

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And like that's-- I don't think most sides within the gay community would say that they're asexual. Because they-- 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Probably not, no. There are plenty of reasons to not enjoy butt sex aside from just, "I don't like having sexual contact." Um, so like-- and the thing about-

</james>

The- the question is that I had this struggle with my own kind of identity, because I identified as asexual, because, um you know, I- I had *some* sexual drive, I had sexual urges, but like when push came to shove, like I didn't really like doing it that *much*. Um... but I loved think-- I love the buildup to that, I love the lead up to that, I loved
thinking about it, I loved putting myself in situations

Being let down.

<compare>
<nick>

Being let down. Um, and I found that the people that I liked being around the most are the people that I liked spending time around with clothes on. Maybe not with clothes on, but you know, not doing sexual things. Um, and so like for about... seven years, this has been-- this has been dodging me. Seven to ten years, like "what is going on with me," and so I talked to a friend and sort of described that like... described those things and he said, "Okay, when you have your sexual fantasies, when you kind of, you know, go off on your own head, are they about you?" and I'm like, "No, they're about circumstances and situations I make up, sometimes sexual characters," and he's like, "Okay, you're aegosexual." 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

You're what?

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>

Aegosexual. Bit of a mouthful. But when the original studies were done on asexuality-- 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So you're full of yourself.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

... the researcher realized that there's a very strange pattern among some of the research subjects where they have sexual desire, they *desire* desire, but they didn't really have... they didn't really find sex-- fulfillment in sex. Um, the original term was, forgive me, but auto-chro-is... autochroissexuality, which was more of a mouthful than aegosexual, but the people of asexuals decided that aegosexual is probably a better way to say it. It means that you are the ego of your sexuality, and other people don't really have much a factor in there. It means that you arouse yourself, but not that you're aroused *by* yourself, it's just that your imagination does the lifting.

<nick>

Just the fact that we didn't know that the clitoris was as large as it is until like the last 10 years, because we didn't research the inside. [laughs] No one bothered to research what the inside, what the internal elements-- 

</nick>

<james {% include timecode %}>

As someone who had to watch a lot of straight porn as a teenager, uh, because I didn't have internet access and we had a pay-per-view descrambler, I don't know how straight men can't find the clitoris.

It's not hidden. It-- anyway. [laughs] Um, lesbians have been finding it for millennia.

</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Uh so, the... asexuality fandom, uh, Wikipedia describes it as, "being distinguished by the tendency towards having sexual fantasies at times, despite feeling a disconnect between themselves and the sexual targets/object of arousal." My friend described it as, "we desire desire." Uh, this friend also identifies as this, he actually went into gender studies specifically to study this and write a dissertation about this. I'd love to read it.

<james {% include timecode %}>

As you would do.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

[laughs] A legacy format where all the queer-ass furries and uh, communists are. Uh, and aegosexual actually means sexuality without the sex. A-*ego*-sexuality. Um, so I like to participate in sex, as a living sort of subject. I examine myself as a fantasy person. So that's-- that's the context that I like having sex, and that's why I like, don't like doing it that often, because the actual sensation of having it is less than the imagined sensation of what it appears or how it appears to be. Um... 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

It's like people who have, you know, in their fantasies they have, you know, maybe an extreme kink that would be, you know, not necessarily like violence or anything, but something that most people would be like, "Eugh."  

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

I found some of those.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But then in real life, they're just kind of like, "Oh no, I would never actually do it." 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, yeah. And so like, when I say that--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Or they did-- or they would and then it would ruin the fantasy because then they would find out--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, when I say that asexual people can be some of the horniest and kinkiest people you'll ever encounter, it's because that outside of the puritism-- purism of asexuality, there are a myriad of different ways that the human brain is just really weird about sex. Not weird as in bad, but weird as in like, it's... it's complicated, it's complicated. It's uh, "she's *complex*." [laughs] 

But um, so yeah like there are-- these are things that are the subject of research and the subject of academic fascination, even if there isn't really a lot of academic interest in these things. Some people are and we're gonna see start seeing a little bit more of this, but there is a bit of a distinction between these-- between, you know, these sort of more psychological elements of asexual and the more self-identifying ones which, you know, there are a *legion* of flags, um because you know, the asexual community has been kind of... ignored, like we said, by the queer community at large, so I feel like there is a... overtendency to self-identify, and to sort of construct a... version of asexuality around specific, you know, circumstances. 

</nick>
<nick>

And I feel like the pure- the gatekeeping, the purest gatekeeping of asexual aromanticism has led to that. Like, you can't be asexual because you enjoy sex in these circumstances, and it's like, but... yeah, I'm still, you know, I'm still weird about it. Um, and so like it's-- I feel like this is a situation where self-identified-- having the openness to just identify, self-identify as asexual, meaning like, I don't fit the sexual norm of either the cishet hegemony *or* the queer community so I need to belong here, because I don't belong anywhere-- anywhere else. 

Um, and I really hope we can start moving towards that, because I hate seeing so much fragmentation within-- within sub communities. Because it-- it does cut-- I feel like there is an extent, like yeah, it's important to recognize the distinction between gays and lesbians and bisexual people and how, uh, and especially trans people in the LGB*T*, and how the cishet hegemony *uniquely* persecutes against each of these camps of people, and different cocktails of privilege that they might enjoy--

> **Evie:** [...] But I think even members of our community, especially if you are more used to, like, being in Gay men’s spaces, you’re seeing that perspective maybe more than the Ace perspective, and you might not fully realize, like, what the extent of reality is, because it’s so erased and not talked about, that, like, yeah, if you don’t ever see the houses on fire, you don’t ever realize that there’s houses on fire. And you know, you got to have somebody point it out to you for you to realize, “Hey, actually, there’s a lot of houses on fire.” It’s not that homes never catch on fire.
>
> **Royce:** And there is something to be said for the difference in personal experience. Men are often less likely to need to tell their doctor that they’re Asexual in the first place. You don’t have to deal with the potential of getting pregnancy tests or things like that.
> 
> **Courtney:** Yeah, I have faced quite a lot of medical issues. And I do know, too – and I think most Aces who were at least on social media around the time that… oh, I can’t think of the exact drug name, but it was being peddled as like “female Viagra” at one point. 
> 
> **Evie:** Yeah. I left that in my comment [on James's Ace video] and was like, “Oh, remember this?”
>
> **Courtney:** Oh gosh! I joined some Asexual Facebook groups when I joined Facebook, and I was like, *immediately* after I clicked away from that group, within *minutes* of joining it, it was like, “Here is libido medication for women!” just targeted ad at me every single day, and it’s like, [sighs].
>
> **Courtney:** And so yeah, it’s kind of also, you know, what is conversion therapy? And I do think that even Gay men who have not experienced conversion therapy firsthand themselves, sometimes – and I’m not saying that this is specifically James or Nick I’m just talking broadly speaking – a lot of people don’t tend to really even know what conversion therapy looks like or what the full scope of it can be. Because I think – well, *especially*, *especially* straight people just think of it as, like, the Christian camps you get sent to.
>
> **Evie:** Yup.
> 
> **Courtney:** Which is very much an issue. Do not get me wrong. But there is also medical conversion therapy. And there are things like corrective sexual assault that do get statistically lumped in with types of conversion therapy as well. So there are a lot of different forms conversion therapy can take. And depending on what the orientation is and what form it’s taking, it might not get as much widespread discussion as some of the other ones. [...] I mean, James’s following is huge. We just… we get so many people saying, like, “Well, Aces don’t face conversion therapy, so they’re not oppressed.” And it’s like, *gahhhhh*, I don’t want anything to reinforce that, because [we have seen the studies.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-lgbt-survey-summary-repor)

<james {% include timecode %}>

That gay men will, in particular, kind of push back against all the other letters in the alphabet.

</james>
<nick>

That's- that's- honey, that's a whole other discussion, I'm talking about how the persecution of a gay man is different than a gay woman.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Is different from a bisexual man, is different from a bisexual woman...

</james>
<nick>

And especially it gets different when you factor in people of color, and how these respective communities approach queerness.

</nick>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Very different. 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Uh, and so like, there is-- it is important to recognize the difference in discrimination and the difference in the dynamics, of social dynamics as they fit into the society at large but-- And so I feel like if, if your version of this thing doesn't really change the dynamic of persecution against you, or the manifestation of your relationship with the culture, then I don't- I don't feel like it's... like, it's fine if you want to kind of have this sort of label on yourself, but make sure you're putting the label there yourself, don't let anyone else label you but you. Um...that's fine, but I feel like a formal definition or distinction of this kind of does take away from a lot of the discussion especially when you get cis people- straight people- cis straight people who are like, [in a mocking voice] "There are so many more letters than there used to be, I just can't keep up," and it's like, don't try. [laughs]

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah that's- you know, we made a whole video talking about why we need to just get rid of the letters and just go for an umbrella term--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Oh yeah, describing it to like, um--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And a big part of that I think is, you know, if there was "queer" as an umbrella term, then all the different flavors of asexuality would be, you know, you wouldn't have-- you couldn't devalue different kinds of asexual, because, you know they're all on the same turf as all the other ones. That an asexual who is incredibly horny but only for a specific type of person, you know, is on the same level as an asexual who has absolutely no interest in sex whatsoever and they just want to, you know, play D&D. Um, and that's one of the reasons I do think--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Funny fact, um, people who play D&D get laid more than you would believe. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But yeah that's, that's-- like I said, that's why I think there should be an overarching term that isn't so, uh... 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

And I don't blame the, the... fragmentation on individuals needing to be special stars, I blame it on... purist gatekeeping.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Oh absolutely, absolutely.


</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

And I want to be clear about that, like I-- you know. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Like the gold star gay thing. 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, the platinum star gay. [laughs] [in a mocking voice] "I had a C-section."  

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, like I was born via C-section.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Were you? 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah! 48 hours at labor beforehand. But um, before we continue we will do
one last break and uh, then we'll come back with our final thoughts.

</james>

## Segment 4

<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And welcome back to the show, Gays Behaving Badly, that's what we're called.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

We haven't really been behaving that badly today. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So yeah, in, you know, closing thoughts section would be kind of... uh... 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

You were saying that, uh, we'd just watched *Helluva Boss*, uh and you watched the... 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

*Hazbin Hotel*.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

... which was the thing that's a spin off of, and you said that there is an asexual character and you quite enjoyed that. I haven't watched it, so...


</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well, they're identified in the wiki as asexual, like they don't say it in the show, but because, you know, they only have one episode, he only pops in at the end of the episode. Um, but the creator and the-- in the wiki, they are, I think, identified as asexual. Um, and I thought that was cool because basically Hazbin-- between *Hazbin Hotel* and *Helluva Boss*, every letter of the alphabet is identified, every one of them. 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

[laughs] They cover *all* the sexualities.


</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Um... because apparently even in *Helluva Boss*, Moxxie is bisexual.


</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

... I buy that.


</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Which I didn't-- I- I didn't read that. 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Moxxie's the cute little boy, right? 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well he's not a *little boy*, Nick. He's--

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

I know, but like he's-- no, b-o-i.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, he's adorable.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

He's a boi. I mean like I buy that, like not that pegging or getting pegged makes you bi, makes you queer, but like... I-I've seen him kind of be flustered around the boys. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

But yeah there's, you know, a character who is, at least in the wiki, identified as asexual, and you wouldn't guess it from his character. Because, you know, he's not the Sheldon or the Data or the alien-- 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

And he, uh, I like that in *Helluva Boss*, um, monogamous is the, um... is the taboo. That's the one that nobody likes to talk about, or is so annoyed--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well, because it's hell.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah yeah, I- I just really, really enjoyed that, sort of flipping the script. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah. But I would like to see more of that going forward, even if it's-- If it's characters that are, uh, identified as asexual, that would be great.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

But for whom the-- well like, like asexual, does like-- does there need to be a declaration made, or sort of a specification made, or is just the plot acknowledging that there is no romantic future for this character - ergh, that sounds so bleak - but there is no *intended* romantic future for this character. Um, and this character is comfortable with that. Is just writing that into the character and into the plot enough, or uh... is that good enough, or does there need to be a soapbox moment? 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, and I mean that's that's kind of a question with gay stuff too, is it okay to just have a gay character who is a great character, or do they *have* to have a boyfriend to confirm the gayness. Um, you know it's like, in *Wakanda Forever*, there is a lesbian character, and she's pretty badass throughout the movie. She only has, you know, that one moment where it's *confirmed* that she is queer and a lot of people say, you know, "that's really good representation," and a lot of people say, "that doesn't count because--" 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

... it can be sucked out for, for screening in China. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Which it is being, it's-- the movie's not getting a Chinese release, um, but it is being, uh, it has been *requested* to be removed by Kuwait. Um, so it's short enough to be removed, and so does it count if it is so insubstantial that it is removable. Now that's a whole other discussion, that'll be a video. Not necessarily about *Wakanda Forever* but about that whole thing, um... 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

When it comes to gay people, I like, I- I don't like having the soapbox moment, because I don't think straight-- when you have gay representation, when you want to have gay representation, straight people don't need gay representation, gay people need gay-- queer people need queer representation. Um, so having that soapbox moment where you explain to queer-- to *straight* people that it's okay to be gay... that's not useful to us, because we already have these messages, we already have-- And the ways that gay people, or queer people would interpret self-acceptance is different than the way that straight people would interpret accepting queer people. So there needs to be two very different manifestations of how this media handles that thing. So--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And, you know, with a gay character I think, you know, I- I am growing more okay with the incidental-- well I like the incidentally queer characters, um, the ones-- that there is no soapbox moment. I like it if maybe they actively show their attraction to someone of the same sex. But for an asexual character, I think it would be enough--


</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Like Luz, from *The Owl House*! I think that is like--

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

She's not asexual. 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Bisexual, she's bisexual, but like that kind of attitude, where it's apparent but it's never made a deal out of, no one really questions it and she doesn't need to get on a soapbox because everyone's like, "oh, okay."

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

 Yeah, but with an asexual character, I think it would be enough to have another character kind of say, you know, like the stereotypical, "you just need to get laid," like "oh you're stressed out, you just need to get laid." And then they'd be like, "I don't *like* doing that." And then that's enough.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

But yeah like-- and I've always kind of felt like there are ways-- instead of having that soapbox moment driving that identification, you *can* do that, but also there are ways that uh, queer people, asexual people, bisexual people, they interact with the world differently than other people of different sort of camps. So as long as you write that in and you do it earnestly-- 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And I think your opinion-- as an asexual person, your opinion on this matters more than mine does. [laughs]

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

But like, I also don't want to speak for the entire ace community, I think that you do need a balance of soapbox moments, as well as you need to have that incidental representation.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, like I feel like the soapbox moments should be like, on Disney+, should be made on- for TV shows, for movies for kids and teenagers. 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

But I think you also need that mix of uh, Phastos from... *Eternals*, where like, his motivation was inseparable from his, you know, really, from his gay- gay marriage.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Oh yeah, absolutely! Yeah um, I- I do think that kind of representation is
important, I think we need a *mix*, and that's the thing that, you know, cis straight Holly-- males, old white Hollywood executives don't get is, they think that, "okay, this is how we do representation" instead of saying-- 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

As a-- as a formula, because it's like, "as long as we do *this* then they'll be happy" and it's like, but you gotta do other things too. And it's like, "that's too much." Which- which-- and that's like the sort of thing, which representation do we use for this media, and it's like, you need to let a creative person do that, in which they point, they-- their heads start spinning around and they start throwing up um, pea soup. And God forbid let a creative person do something.[laughs]

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

So I think that's kind of the message of this, is maybe, maybe, to any executives listening, let the creative people tell the stories. Because you know, there are plenty of straight people who have told great gay stories, God knows there's plenty of gay people who have told great straight
stories.

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Oh my god, right.

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

And there are plenty of people out there who are asexual, who have stories to tell, that might be hilarious comedies or might be very-- 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Oh, asexuality is absolutely hilarious, I can-- everything that I've kind of said in here that's kind of like, "oh, poor Nick," no, it can be funny with a different-- [laughs]

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Well yeah, like at the same time, like it can be really funny stories, they can be comedies, they could be dramas, and they have stories to tell, so maybe let them tell them instead of having someone who is definitely not asexual say, "this is what I think one of them is."

So that's the end of the first episode of Gays Behaving Badly!

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

Yeah, tell us what you think, we know you will. [laughs]

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Yeah, um, we know you will. Um, if you liked it, let us know in the comments, if you didn't, um... 

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

[singing] "If you liked our show, tell everyone that. And if you think this sucks, keep your big--" [normal voice] It's from, it's the um...

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

I've heard that before...

</james>
</compare> 
<compare>
<nick>

It's from *The Producers*, it's their encore. 

</nick>
</compare>
<compare>
<james {% include timecode %}>

Ohh, right right right. Yeah, um, so yeah, let us know in the comments if you like this style. If so, we'll do one a month. Um, and if there's any topics that we try to avoid as a community but you think are kind of important to talk about, leave them down in the comments. 

Um, so until maybe next month, or the next video, or the next podcast, or the next podreon, or whatever next thing we put out--

Whatever's happening next.
