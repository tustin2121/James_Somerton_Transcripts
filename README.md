# James Somerton Transcripts

Project creator TerraJRiley:
> After HBomberGuy's latest video "Plagiarism and You(Tube)" I was incredibly dissapointed to hear that a creator I followed had been doing a whole bunch of plagiarism.  So, I dusted of my old Google Developer account and grabbed all the transcripts that I could get at the time of writing.  If I'm REALLY lucky then I'll also find an easy way to actually check all of these for plagiarism.

See the [Transcript Index](docs/INDEX.md). Or [go to the webpage](https://tustin2121.github.io/James_Somerton_Transcripts) to see the formatted versions. Feel free to pull request [on the repo](https://github.com/tustin2121/James_Somerton_Transcripts).
